Man homes worldwide will now own a HP printer, and it's easy to understand why when you take a look a the wide selection of printer they currently sell on the market. 

The HP range of printers are able to cater for all printing processes, and to date there are Ink jet printers, Laser Jet printers and just recently the All In One Printer. The All in One printer is the latest addition to the market and in previous times, you will have had to have purchased a fax machine, a scanner, a photocopier and a printer. The addition of the all in one printer makes this a problem of the past as you can now own a machine that will be able to do all of these tasks for you, worth the simple press of a button. 

The HP 3210 all in one printer is a part of the HP PhotoSmart series.
