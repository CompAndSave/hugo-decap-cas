## Knowing the Fundamentals When Buying Ink Cartridges

Understanding the different types of printers and their corresponding cartridges is essential for making an informed purchase. The type of printer you have determines the kind of cartridges you need.

### Types of Printers

[What ink does my printer use?](https://www.compandsave.com/what-ink-does-my-printer-use) Printers use different types of cartridges based on their technology. Knowing these differences ensures you select the right cartridge.

**Inkjet vs. Laser Printers**

**1. Inkjet printers** use liquid ink sprayed through tiny nozzles onto the paper, ideal for high-quality color prints and photos. These printers use either dye-based or pigment-based inks. 

**a. Dye-based inks** offer vibrant colors but fade quickly, making them perfect for vivid photo prints and graphics.

**b. Pigment-based inks** are more durable and water-resistant, ideal for archival prints and outdoor displays like signage.

**2. Laser printers** use powdered toner, making them suitable for high-volume text documents due to their speed and efficiency.

### Types of Ink Cartridges

When buying ink cartridges, it's important to understand the different types available to make an informed decision. This section will explore the main types of ink cartridges: OEM, compatible, and remanufactured.

**A) Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Cartridges**

OEM cartridges are produced by the same company that made your printer. For example, HP cartridges for HP printers.

**B) Compatible (Third-Party) Cartridges**

Compatible cartridges are made by third-party manufacturers. They are designed to work with specific printer models but are not made by the original printer manufacturer.

**C) Remanufactured Cartridges**

Remanufactured cartridges are recycled OEM cartridges that have been cleaned, refilled, and tested.

Understanding your printer type and the ink it uses helps you make better decisions when you buy cartridge for printer, ensuring you choose products that enhance your printer’s performance and meet your printing needs.

## 7 Factors to Consider When Buying Printer Cartridges

When buying printer cartridges, it's essential to keep in mind these key factors to ensure you get the best quality and value for your money.

### 1) Printer Compatibility

Choosing the correct ink cartridge is crucial for optimal printer performance.

High-quality ink ensures vibrant colors, sharp text, and long-lasting prints.
