## Knowing the Fundamentals When Buying Ink Cartridges

Understanding the different types of printers and their corresponding cartridges is essential for making an informed purchase. The type of printer you have determines the kind of cartridges you need.

### Types of Printers

[What ink does my printer use?](https://www.compandsave.com/what-ink-does-my-printer-use) Printers use different types of cartridges based on their technology. Knowing these differences ensures you select the right cartridge.

**Inkjet vs. Laser Printers**

**1. Inkjet printers** use liquid ink sprayed through tiny nozzles onto the paper, ideal for high-quality color prints and photos. These printers use either dye-based or pigment-based inks. 

**a. Dye-based inks** offer vibrant colors but fade quickly, making them perfect for vivid photo prints and graphics.

**b. Pigment-based inks** are more durable and water-resistant, ideal for archival prints and outdoor displays like signage.

**2. Laser printers** use powdered toner, making them suitable for high-volume text documents due to their speed and efficiency.

### Types of Ink Cartridges

When buying ink cartridges, it's important to understand the different types available to make an informed decision. This section will explore the main types of ink cartridges: OEM, compatible, and remanufactured.

A) Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Cartridges

OEM cartridges are produced by the same company that made your printer. For example, HP cartridges for HP printers.
