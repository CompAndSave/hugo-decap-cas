Do you find yourself thinking about how to save money on printer ink? If so, you're not alone. In fact, printer ink is one of the most commonly spent items in office or home budgets. But how to save on printer ink without sacrificing quality or functionality?

In this post, we'll discuss tips on how to save ink when printing and where to find the cheapest ink cartridges. So sit back and relax - you're in for a good read.

## How to Save Money on Printer Ink? Top 10 Tips

Saving on printer ink is quick and easy when you know the right ways. We've narrowed it down to 10 useful ink saving tips. Let's start with the first tip on how to use less ink when printing.

### Tip #1 - Go for High-yield

How to save money on printer ink cartridges? Buy high-yield variants. This is one of the most crucial things to keep in mind to save the ink. Cartridges typically come in three types:

Standard Cartridges

High-yield Cartridges

Extra High-yield Cartridges

The prices vary, with the standard being the cheapest. Take note that not all types of ink cartridges have variants with higher yields. Those who use less printer ink can go for standard cartridges, but if you print on a regular basis, go for high or extra high yield, depending on your needs. The higher yield may be expensive up front, but its cost per page is lower compared to standard yield cartridges, so you can get more savings if you print regularly.

Check out the Canon 240 and 241 ink cartridges that have standard, high-yield, and extra high-yield variants. Look at the printer ink savings you can have by purchasing the higher yield.

Tip #2: Buy Ink in Bulk

Buying printer ink cartridges in bulk is another tip on how to save money on ink. This way, you can purchase a set number of inks for a lower price than if you bought them separately.



For instance, buying CompAndSave's combo pack of Remanfuactured High-yield Canon PG-240XL black and CL-241XL color ink cartridges, will help you save $11.00. It's 20% off compared to purchasing it at the retail price. Plus, buying combo packs in a set quantity (over $50) comes with free shipping, making it an even more valuable offer for you to save ink.



Interested in getting printer cartridges at a wholesale price? CompAndSave offers competitive wholesale pricing for resellers. Save on cartridges, especially if you have a printing business or you print at home frequently.



Tip #3: Use Color Ink When Needed

Another ink saving tip is slowing down on colored cartridges. Most of the printer's expenses are eaten up by colored inks. This is because they are expensive, and you need to purchase multiple color cartridges to print out the right colored documents.This is not the case when using black ink, as only one color is used throughout the document. Therefore, we suggest using color print only when it's essential, like for presentation reports. Otherwise, rely on black prints to save on printer ink.



Tip #4: Utilize Grayscale

How to save ink when printing? Stemming from the last point, we suggest that you use grayscale printing when you want to print something in black and white. This is due to the printer's use of various inks to create black color rather than directly using black ink. Reduce your colored ink consumption by doing the steps below:



Open Devices and Printersfrom the control panel or type it in the search bar.

Select the correct printer model and right-click on it.

Choose Printing Preferences.

Click the Color tab.

Click Print in Grayscale, then click Apply.

Tip #5: Empty the Cartridge

The fifth tip on our list to save money on ink, is emptying your cartridge. Your printer will warn you when your ink cartridge is about to run out. Many people just replace the cartridges after the initial few warnings. However, there's still 10-30% ink left inside that can give you a few hundred printouts.



So we suggest not throwing out the cartridges on the first few warnings; you can buy and keep replacements in the case when the current cartridges are fully empty. However, keep using them until every single drop is squeezed out to save on ink cartridges.



Useful Tip:Try shaking the used ink cartridges gently, especially if the printer is kept in a humid climate, to break up ink clogs. This can give you a few additional prints.



Tip #6: Keep the Prints Coming

You may think that using your printer less is economical, but in reality, that's not a great way to save ink. Keeping your printer turned off for weeks can result in the ink drying up in the nozzles. Not only does this waste your ink, but it may also require repairs to get the nozzles working again, costing you more money.



Furthermore, the printer uses more ink to get ready to print when it's used after a long gap. So we suggest not turning off your printer completely; use it whenever you can, even if you only print at least 1 page a week. When the nozzles are clogged, learn how to clean the printhead of your cartridges so you can use the remaining contents and save money on printer ink.
