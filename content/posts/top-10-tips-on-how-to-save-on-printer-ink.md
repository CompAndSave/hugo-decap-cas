How to Save Money on Printer Ink? Top 10 Tips

Saving on printer ink is quick and easy when you know the right ways. We've narrowed it down to 10 useful ink saving tips. Let's start with the first tip on how to use less ink when printing.



Tip #1 - Go for High-yield

How to save money on printer ink cartridges? Buy high-yield variants. This is one of the most crucial things to keep in mind to save the ink. Cartridges typically come in three types:



Standard Cartridges

High-yield Cartridges

Extra High-yield Cartridges

The prices vary, with the standard being the cheapest. Take note that not all types of ink cartridges have variants with higher yields. Those who use less printer ink can go for standard cartridges, but if you print on a regular basis, go for high or extra high yield, depending on your needs. The higher yield may be expensive up front, but its cost per page is lower compared to standard yield cartridges, so you can get more savings if you print regularly.



Check out the Canon 240 and 241 ink cartridges that have standard, high-yield, and extra high-yield variants. Look at the printer ink savings you can have by purchasing the higher yield.
