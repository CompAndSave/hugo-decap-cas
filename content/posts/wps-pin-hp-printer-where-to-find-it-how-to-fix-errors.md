Is your HP printer refusing to connect? You’re in good company. Many users run into the same issue when setting up their printer, especially when the screen suddenly asks for a WPS PIN HP printer code they’ve never seen before. This small 8-digit number is crucial to [connect printer to WiFi](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-connect-printer-to-wi-fi-wireless-printing-guide.html) securely, but figuring out where to find WPS PIN on HP printer isn’t always obvious.

The WPS PIN method is one of the safest ways to establish a wireless connection without cables, yet it confuses both new and experienced HP owners. You might see a message like “Enter WPS PIN to continue” and wonder, What is a WPS PIN for a HP printer, and where do I get it?

**In this guide, you’ll get:**

* A clear explanation of the WPS PIN HP printer method
* Step-by-step instructions on how to find the WPS PIN for my HP printer
* Easy directions to enter the PIN and finish your Wi-Fi setup
* Practical fixes when the WPS PIN doesn’t work

## **What Is a WPS PIN (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) and Why Does It Matter**

WPS PIN (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is an 8-digit number generated by your HP printer. It allows you to connect your printer to your wireless router without needing to manually enter a Wi-Fi password. It's a secure way to establish a direct connection between your printer and your Wi-Fi network.

The WPS PIN HP printer system prevents unauthorized users from accessing your printer, making it ideal for home and small office use. The PIN is unique and time-sensitive, usually valid for only 5 to 10 minutes after being generated.

### **Why HP Uses WPS PINs for Wireless Setup**

HP includes this feature to improve wireless security and ease of setup. Instead of typing passwords, the WPS PIN on HP printer acts like a digital handshake between your printer and your router. This system avoids potential exposure of your network credentials.

This also helps solve some [common printer problems](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-common-printer-problems-tips-for-easy-troubleshooting.html), such as devices not showing up or failing to connect properly due to incorrect Wi-Fi passwords.

### **WPS PIN vs. WPS Push Button: What’s the Difference?**

There are two types of WPS methods used in HP printers:

* **WPS PIN Method:** You enter the WPS PIN HP printer code into your router’s admin page or prompt screen during setup.
* **WPS Push Button Method:** You press a physical WPS button on both the printer and the router to connect automatically.

The WPS PIN method is more secure, while the push-button method is faster and easier, but not all routers support it.

## **Where to Find WPS PIN on HP Printer: All Possible Methods**

If your HP printer asks for a WPS PIN, its location depends on the model. Some display it on-screen, others require printing a report or checking the HP Smart App. Here’s how to quickly find WPS PIN on HP printer and complete the setup.

### **1. Check the Printer Display Panel (Touchscreen Models)**

Where to find WPS PIN on HP printer with a touchscreen?

Navigate through your printer’s menu:

* **Settings → Network Setup → Wireless Settings → Wi-Fi Protected Setup → WPS PIN**

Once you tap "WPS PIN," an 8-digit code appears on the screen. This PIN is valid for approximately 90 to 120 seconds, so you must enter it on your router or computer setup screen quickly.

### **2. Print the Network Configuration Page (Non-Touchscreen Models)**

Non-touchscreen HP printers don’t show the PIN on-screen. Instead, you need to print a network configuration page. Here’s how:

* Press the Wireless + Information buttons together (or refer to your model’s manual).
* Alternatively, use the HP Smart App to print the report remotely.

### **3. Use the HP Smart App to Access WPS PIN**

Another useful option, especially for newer models, is the HP Smart App. Here’s how to use it:

* Download and install HP Smart from the official HP site or your app store.
* Add your printer.
* Go to “**Printer Reports**” or “**Advanced Settings**” → “**Network Settings**.”

### **4. Check the Printer Label or Sticker (If Available)**

Some HP printers, especially business models, include the WPS PIN on a physical label. Here's where to find WPS PIN on HP printer in such cases:

* Back of the printer
* Bottom surface
* Inside the cartridge or scanner lid area

### **5. During PC Setup: Watch the Printer Display**

If you're adding your HP printer using Windows' “Add Printer” or Mac’s Printers & Scanners tool, the WPS PIN might flash on the printer screen during the process.

* Stay near the printer while the setup is running.
* When prompted, check the printer screen immediately; the WPS PIN appears for just 90 seconds.

## **How to Connect HP Printer to Wi-Fi Using WPS PIN?**

Connecting your HP printer to Wi-Fi using a WPS PIN HP printer is a secure way to set up without cables or extra drivers. This method creates a private connection, but the PIN is time-sensitive.

### **Step 1: Turn On Wireless Mode**

* **Printer label/sticker:** On some models, you might find WPS PIN on HP printer printed on the back, bottom, or inside the cartridge door.
* **During setup on PC or Mac:** When adding a new device, a prompt will appear, and the PIN will show on the printer screen.

### **Step 3: Enter the WPS PIN on Your Computer or Router**

* Or press the Information (i) button on your printer. This will print a network configuration page, which usually shows the WPS PIN.

### **4. Try WPS Push Button as an Alternative**

Still stuck? Skip the PIN method altogether and use the WPS Push Button method instead; it’s often easier.

* Press the WPS button on your router and hold it for a few seconds.
* Within 2 minutes, press the Wireless button on your HP printer.

That’s it, your printer and router will handle the connection automatically.
