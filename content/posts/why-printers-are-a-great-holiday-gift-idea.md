You're probably wondering: What's the perfect holiday gift for my business partner/professional friend/college-aged child?

Here's our biggest gift idea — a printer!

Why a printer, you ask? Here are a few reasons why:

**Printers are used everywhere (and by everyone!)**

There are many types of printers out there, and it can be difficult to decide [what kind of printer is best](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/three-reasons-small-business-should-own.html) for an office or home. Printers are becoming more and more common in households, to the point where a 2007 survey suggested that [over 80% of Internet users](https://adverlab.blogspot.com/2009/05/data-how-many-people-own-printer.html) have printers in their house.

Printers are a great holiday gift for anyone

 Market forecasters have predicted that 2012 will be the year of giving and receiving [practical gifts](https://www.marketwire.com/press-release/this-christmas-gift-shoppers-will-take-a-practical-turn-1669285.htm), as opposed to extravagant luxury gifts. And what could be more practical than a printer that you can use over and over for years?


It's also not just small business owners looking for printers this holiday season — college students are also beginning to realize the value of an in-dorm printer. And buying the proper model will guarantee that this will be one Christmas gift that will last far beyond graduation.

**Printers are gifts that keep on giving**

A good inkjet printer should last 3-4 years, and [laser printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser%5Fprinting) can last even longer. Using one printer (without needing to replace it) can save businesses and individual users a lot of money over time. If it utilizes technology like [remanufactured cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/go-green-with-remanufactured-print.html) (which can be used safely in most printers), the savings are even greater!
