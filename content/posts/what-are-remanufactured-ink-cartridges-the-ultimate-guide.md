## What is OEM Printer Ink Cartridge?

These cartridges come from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the printer they're for, like those made by HP for HP printers. However, they're much more expensive than remanufactured or compatible cartridges.

OEM printer ink cartridges cost more than remanufactured ones because OEMs invest heavily in research and development (R&D) of new printer models and their specific cartridges, which requires a lot of money. These cartridges are reliable and sometimes the only option for specific models of printers.

## What is Compatible Ink Cartridge?

Compatible ink cartridges are newly made by third-party ink cartridge manufacturers. These cartridges have brand new parts, including the chips. They cost less because they don't spend on research and development (R&D), instead opting for existing research and processes used by original cartridge manufacturers—resulting in cheaper products overall.

## What is Remanufactured Ink Cartridge?

What does remanufactured ink mean? The word remanufactured means restoring a used item and making it functional again. These replacement cartridges are carefully disassembled, cleaned, and checked for any bad parts. If there are any, they fix or replace them before refilling it with ink. It saves the remanufacturers the huge cost of making new cartridge casings.
