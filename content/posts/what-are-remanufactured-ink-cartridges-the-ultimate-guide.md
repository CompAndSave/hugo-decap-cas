## Printer Ink Cartridges: What Are The Different Types?

Before we know how much you can save with remanufactured cartridges, let's first talk about the different types of cartridges available. This way, you'll have a better idea of whether remanufactured cartridges are the best option for you.

**When it comes to ink cartridges, there are three main types:**

1. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) printer ink cartridges
2. Compatible ink cartridges
3. Remanufactured/Replacement ink cartridges

Let's see what they are.

### 1. OEM Ink Cartridge

These cartridges are made by the printer's original equipment manufacturer (OEM). For example, HP makes cartridges for HP printers. However, they are much more expensive than remanufactured or compatible cartridges.

OEM printer ink cartridges cost more than remanufactured ones because OEMs invest heavily in research and development (R&D) of new printer models and their specific cartridges, which requires a lot of money. These cartridges are reliable and sometimes the only option for specific models of printers.

### 2. Compatible Ink Cartridge

[![Compatible Ink Cartridge](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-12.51.27 pm.png)](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-12.51.27 pm.png)

Compatible ink, like the [Brother LC51 ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/brother/lc51-ink-cartridges/lc51-4-combo?queryID=a5c9779df43d6bc834efd1362c551b31&objectID=9997&indexName=magento2_cas_en_products), are newly made by third-party ink cartridge manufacturers. These cartridges have brand-new parts, including the chips. They cost less because they don't spend on research and development (R&D), instead opting for existing research and processes used by original cartridge manufacturers—resulting in cheaper products overall. 

### 3. Remanufactured Ink Cartridge

What are remanufactured ink cartridges? Well, let’s first define the meaning of the word remanufactured. ***“Remanufactured”*** means restoring a used item and making it functional again. These replacement cartridges are original cartridges that are carefully disassembled, cleaned, and checked for any damaged parts. If there are any, they fix or replace them before refilling them with ink. 

It saves the remanufacturers the considerable cost of making new cartridge casings. These cartridges are often much cheaper than new, original ones, making them a popular choice for saving money while still getting good print quality.
