How to save more on ink cartridges? If you're buying new ink cartridges for your printer, you might be looking for ways to save money without losing print quality. Good news—you can do that!

This guide will tell you about remanufactured cartridges, which is a great, cost-effective option. But what are remanufactured ink cartridges? How do they differ from the original ones?

Let’s cover everything you need to know about using these replacement ink cartridges, including their benefits and any potential challenges. This will help you decide if [remanufactured cartridges are a good choice](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/are-remanufactured-ink-cartridges-good.html) and worth buying.

## Printer Ink Cartridges: What Are The Different Types?

Before we know how much you can save with remanufactured cartridges, let's first talk about the different types of cartridges available. This way, you'll have a better idea of whether remanufactured cartridges are the best option for you.

**When it comes to ink cartridges, there are three main types:**

1. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) printer ink cartridges
2. Compatible ink cartridges
3. Remanufactured/Replacement ink cartridges

Let's see what they are.

### 1. OEM Ink Cartridge

These cartridges are made by the printer's original equipment manufacturer (OEM). For example, HP makes cartridges for HP printers. However, they are much more expensive than remanufactured or compatible cartridges.

OEM printer ink cartridges cost more than remanufactured ones because OEMs invest heavily in research and development (R&D) of new printer models and their specific cartridges, which requires a lot of money. These cartridges are reliable and sometimes the only option for specific models of printers.

### 2. Compatible Ink Cartridge

[![Compatible Ink Cartridge](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-12.51.27 pm.png)](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-12.51.27 pm.png)

Compatible ink, like the [Brother LC51 ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/brother/lc51-ink-cartridges/lc51-4-combo?queryID=a5c9779df43d6bc834efd1362c551b31&objectID=9997&indexName=magento2_cas_en_products), are newly made by third-party ink cartridge manufacturers. These cartridges have brand-new parts, including the chips. They cost less because they don't spend on research and development (R&D), instead opting for existing research and processes used by original cartridge manufacturers—resulting in cheaper products overall.

### 3. Remanufactured Ink Cartridge

What are remanufactured ink cartridges? Well, let’s first define the meaning of the word remanufactured. ***“Remanufactured”*** means restoring a used item and making it functional again. These replacement cartridges are original cartridges that are carefully disassembled, cleaned, and checked for any damaged parts. If there are any, they fix or replace them before refilling them with ink.

It saves the remanufacturers the considerable cost of making new cartridge casings. These cartridges are often much cheaper than new, original ones, making them a popular choice for saving money while still getting good print quality.

## What Are Remanufactured Ink Cartridges’ Advantage Vs. OEM?

Remanufactured printer ink cartridges, also called replacement ink cartridges, are very popular. But why should you choose them over the original ones? Here are the pros of using remanufactured ink cartridges vs new cartridges:

### 1. Cost Savings

Remanufactured cartridges are often much cheaper than brand-new OEM cartridges, sometimes costing only half as much. A lower cartridge price means a lower cost per page. You can have great savings on your printing costs, especially when purchasing the higher yield cartridges. You can check out the sample table below of one of the best-selling cartridges for a more specific comparison.

### 2. Environmental Benefits

These cartridges help reduce waste by [reusing old cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/remanufactured-printer-cartridges-how-are-they-made.html) that would otherwise end up in landfills. This makes remanufactured cartridges a more sustainable choice, contributing to a greener environment.

### 3. Good Print Quality

While remanufactured cartridges are cheaper, they often provide print quality that is the same as the original. These cartridges are carefully tested to ensure that they meet certain quality standards. As a result, you can expect sharp text and vibrant colors that are comparable to what you would get from an OEM cartridge.

### 4. Wide Availability

Remanufactured cartridges are widely available for a variety of printer brands and models, including popular ones like HP, Canon, and Epson. This means that, regardless of the printer you use, you can likely find a remanufactured cartridge that fits your machine.

### 5. Will Not Void Printer Warranty

Using remanufactured ink cartridges generally will not void your printer’s warranty. According to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, manufacturers cannot require you to use their OEM ink cartridges to maintain your warranty. This federal law ensures that you have the right to choose alternative, cheaper cartridges without losing your warranty coverage.

### 6. Page Yield

Yes, you will get the same page yield as an original brand cartridge-unless you are using a badly made replacement printer ink. Reputable brands' remanufactured cartridges come with a warranty in case something goes wrong, so you're still covered if your cartridge breaks down. However, make sure to purchase your ink cartridges from a reputable source—not just any online store.

## Best Remanufactured Ink Cartridges: 7 Tips for Buying

Are remanufactured ink cartridges good or bad? Well, it depends on where you buy them. To ensure you get a high-quality product that works well, purchase remanufactured cartridges from a trusted vendor. To help you with that, here are some essential tips to consider when looking for the best remanufactured ink and toner cartridges:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Can I use remanufactured ink cartridges (would it void my printer warranty if I use one)?

The answer is no! No such regulation says that printer users of a specific brand cannot use replacement cartridges. Even though printer companies don't want you to do this for obvious reasons, they can't stop you.

In the same way, using remanufactured inks does not invalidate a warranty or a refund that could be given if the printer breaks. There's a law that protects you in such cases called the Magnuson Moss Warranty Improvement Act. This law allows third-party cartridge use, which means you are not limited to using ink cartridges from the printer manufacturer. That said, you can easily use remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges!

### 2. Are remanufactured ink cartridges any good?

The answer is a definite yes! Remanufactured ink cartridges are just as reliable as the original ones. However, if you buy from an ill-reputed brand, the cartridge or ink quality might not be as good. So, thoroughly research online sellers before purchasing remanufactured printer ink cartridges.

### 3. What is the shelf life of a remanufactured ink cartridge?

The shelf life of a remanufactured ink cartridge is about two years if it stays in its sealed packaging. Once you open it, the cartridge usually lasts around six months before the ink starts to degrade or dry out, which can affect the print quality. To keep it fresh, store it in a cool, dry place.
