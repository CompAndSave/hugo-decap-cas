How to save more on ink cartridges? If you're buying new ink cartridges for your printer, you might be looking for ways to save money without losing print quality. Good news—you can do that!

This guide will tell you about remanufactured cartridges, which is a great, cost-effective option. But what are remanufactured ink cartridges? How do they differ from the original ones? 

Let’s cover everything you need to know about using these replacement ink cartridges, including their benefits and any potential challenges.

## Printer Ink Cartridges: What Are The Different Types?

Before we know how much you can save with remanufactured cartridges, let's first talk about the different types of cartridges available. This way, you'll have a better idea of whether remanufactured cartridges are the best option for you.

**When it comes to ink cartridges, there are three main types:**

1. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) printer ink cartridges
2. Compatible ink cartridges
3. Remanufactured/Replacement ink cartridges

Let's see what they are.

### 1. OEM Ink Cartridge

These cartridges are made by the printer's original equipment manufacturer (OEM). For example, HP makes cartridges for HP printers. However, they are much more expensive than remanufactured or compatible cartridges.

OEM printer ink cartridges cost more than remanufactured ones because OEMs invest heavily in research and development (R&D) of new printer models and their specific cartridges, which requires a lot of money. These cartridges are reliable and sometimes the only option for specific models of printers.

### 2. Compatible Ink Cartridge

[![Compatible Ink Cartridge](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-12.51.27 pm.png)](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-30-at-12.51.27 pm.png)

Compatible ink, like the [Brother LC51 ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/brother/lc51-ink-cartridges/lc51-4-combo?queryID=a5c9779df43d6bc834efd1362c551b31&objectID=9997&indexName=magento2_cas_en_products), are newly made by third-party ink cartridge manufacturers. These cartridges have brand-new parts, including the chips. They cost less because they don't spend on research and development (R&D), instead opting for existing research and processes used by original cartridge manufacturers—resulting in cheaper products overall. 

### 3. Remanufactured Ink Cartridge

What are remanufactured ink cartridges? Well, let’s first define the meaning of the word remanufactured. ***“Remanufactured”*** means restoring a used item and making it functional again. These replacement cartridges are original cartridges that are carefully disassembled, cleaned, and checked for any damaged parts. If there are any, they fix or replace them before refilling them with ink. 

It saves the remanufacturers the considerable cost of making new cartridge casings. These cartridges are often much cheaper than new, original ones, making them a popular choice for saving money while still getting good print quality.

## What Are Remanufactured Ink Cartridges’ Advantage Vs. OEM?

Remanufactured printer ink cartridges, also called replacement ink cartridges, are very popular. But why should you choose them over the original ones? Here are the pros of using remanufactured ink cartridges vs new cartridges:

### 1. Cost Savings

Remanufactured cartridges are often much cheaper than brand-new OEM cartridges, sometimes costing only half as much. A lower cartridge price means a lower cost per page. You can have great savings on your printing costs, especially when purchasing the higher yield cartridges. You can check out the sample table below of one of the best-selling cartridges for a more specific comparison.

### 2. Environmental Benefits

These cartridges help reduce waste by [reusing old cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/remanufactured-printer-cartridges-how-are-they-made.html) that would otherwise end up in landfills. This makes remanufactured cartridges a more sustainable choice, contributing to a greener environment.

### 3. Good Print Quality

While remanufactured cartridges are cheaper, they often provide print quality that is the same as the original. These cartridges are carefully tested to ensure that they meet certain quality standards. As a result, you can expect sharp text and vibrant colors that are comparable to what you would get from an OEM cartridge.

### 4. Wide Availability

Remanufactured cartridges are widely available for a variety of printer brands and models, including popular ones like HP, Canon, and Epson. This means that, regardless of the printer you use, you can likely find a remanufactured cartridge that fits your machine. 

### 5. Will Not Void Printer Warranty

Using remanufactured ink cartridges generally will not void your printer’s warranty. According to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, manufacturers cannot require you to use their OEM ink cartridges to maintain your warranty. This federal law ensures that you have the right to choose alternative, cheaper cartridges without losing your warranty coverage. 

### 6. Page Yield 

Yes, you will get the same page yield as an original brand cartridge-unless you are using a badly made replacement printer ink. Reputable brands' remanufactured cartridges come with a warranty in case something goes wrong, so you're still covered if your cartridge breaks down. However, make sure to purchase your ink cartridges from a reputable source—not just any online store.

## Best Remanufactured Ink Cartridges: 7 Tips for Buying 

Are remanufactured ink cartridges good or bad? Well, it depends on where you buy them. To ensure you get a high-quality product that works well, purchase remanufactured cartridges from a trusted vendor. To help you with that, here are some essential tips to consider when looking for the best remanufactured ink and toner cartridges:

### 1. Read Remanufactured Ink Cartridges Reviews

Check customer reviews before buying remanufactured ink cartridges. Reviews can give you an idea of the cartridge’s performance, print quality, and reliability, helping you choose a reliable product.

### 2. Compare the Prices

Price is one of the most important things to consider before buying a remanufactured ink cartridge. Always compare the prices of different sellers and ensure there is at least a 20-30% difference between OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and remanufactured products.

This way, you can be confident that you are getting good value for your money. CompandSave offers up to 50% savings on remanufactured ink cartridges, so feel free to check out our collection.

### 3. Check the Better Business Bureau Profile

Before buying anything online, checking the company’s Better Business Bureau (BBB) profile and reading customer reviews is a good idea. This helps you assess the company’s reputation and see if there have been any complaints. Look for businesses with at least 4 stars and a B+ rating or higher.

### 4. Look for the Perks

When shopping, customers always look for extra perks like free shipping for maximum value out of their purchase. Fortunately, we have you covered! Not only do we offer free shipping on orders over $50 worth of replacement printer ink, but we also offer discount coupons so you can save even more money.

### 5. Pick a Company with Good Customer Service

At CompandSave, our customer service department is ready to help with any questions or problems that might come up while you're shopping on our website for remanufactured printer cartridges or compatible inks.

### 6. Be Aware of the Return/Replace Policy

Always check the store's return/replacement policy before you buy. In case there's something wrong with the product after you've bought it, CompandSave offers a warranty that lasts for 365 days. So, if the remanufactured printer cartridges are broken or don't work, let us know within this period. Contact us, and we'll refund you or replace the cartridge hassle-free!

### 7. Learn About the Warranty

Before purchasing, read the ink cartridge's specifications online; this will give you a better idea of the product you're purchasing. Some cartridge brands may only offer a 30-day warranty, while others go up to 1 year.

Second, remember that CompAndSave's refilled cartridges and remanufactured toner come with a 100% satisfaction guarantee. So if, for any reason, you don't see value in your purchase, we will be happy to refund the paid amount or replace the product within the first year of ownership.
