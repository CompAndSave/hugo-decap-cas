You swapped in a new toner, but your Brother printer didn’t get the memo? That “low toner” alert is a common and irritating issue.

You follow every step, install the cartridge correctly, and yet that blinking warning just won’t go away. It’s enough to make you question whether you need to [replace toner on Brother printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-replace-toner-on-brother-printer.html). The truth is, Brother printers don’t read toner levels the way you think. They estimate usage based on page counts, and that often triggers false low toner alerts.

So what’s the fix? You need a Brother toner reset, a simple process that tells your machine: “Yes, I replaced the cartridge!”

## **Why Your Brother Printer Still Shows “Low Toner” After You Replace Toner**

You’ve just replaced the toner on your Brother printer, but the screen still says “low toner.” This is a common issue caused by how Brother printers track toner through page counts, not actual toner levels. Here are common reasons:

### **Brother Tracks Pages, Not Toner Levels**

Brother printers estimate toner use based on page output, not by checking the actual toner. This often leads to false warnings, especially if the counter isn’t reset. That’s why resetting toner on Brother printer is required.

### **Compatible Cartridges Don’t Auto-Reset**

Using remanufactured or third-party cartridges? The chip might not trigger an automatic reset, leaving the “low toner” message. A manual Brother toner reset is needed to clear it.

### **Why Brother MFC Models See This Often**

This issue is common with MFC models. A Brother MFC toner reset is often required after every new cartridge, even if it’s full.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: Resetting Toner on Brother Printer**

Still seeing the “low toner” message even after you replace toner on Brother printer? If you're using a touchscreen model, there's a simple fix. Most toner reset processes follow a hidden sequence that lets you manually clear the warning and resume printing. Here is the process:

### **Step 1: Open the Front Cover**

Lift the front cover of your Brother MFC printer. It’s typically located just above the paper tray. Opening this gives you access to the toner cartridges.

**Tip:** If you’re unsure, refer to your printer’s manual or look for a labeled handle near the bottom of the control panel.

### **Step 2: Access the Hidden Toner Reset Menu**

With the cover open, press and hold the “Back” or “Stop/Exit” button on the touchscreen. On some models, tapping a blank area of the screen (top-left corner) for 5–10 seconds will reveal the secret reset menu.

### **Step 3: Select the Toner to Reset**

Once the reset menu appears, choose the toner color:

* BK (Black)
* C (Cyan)
* M (Magenta)
* Y (Yellow)

Next, select the yield type:

* STD (Standard)
* STR (Starter or high-yield)

Each toner has its counter. To complete the toner reset, you must do this for each color cartridge you've changed.

### **Step 4: Confirm the Reset**

Tap “OK” or “Reset.” A message like “Accepted” should appear, confirming the reset. This is the critical point on how to fix low toner on Brother printer.

### **Step 5: Close the Cover and Test Print**

Close the front cover. Your printer will recalibrate, and the “Toner Low” message should disappear. Now run a test print. If the issue is resolved, then the Brother MFC toner reset works. If not, repeat the steps or try a different cartridge.

## **Brother Toner Reset: Model-Specific Instructions**

If your Brother still shows a low toner warning after replacing the cartridge, it’s likely due to how it tracks toner use by page count, not actual toner levels. This is common with these models. Whether using original or compatible toner, a quick reset solves it. Here's a simple guide.
