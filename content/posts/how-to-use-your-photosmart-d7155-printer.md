When it comes to searching for a new printer, the HP PhotoSmart D7155 printer really does have it all. It does not matter what you require a printer for, as this model of printer is of the all in one variation, which means that it will be able to accomplish all printing tasks that you require. The PhotoSmart range of printer have been on the market for several years now, however HP keep on bringing new models out onto the market, of which will consist of the latest in printing technology. 

The PhotoSmart D7155 is a printer which has not been the market for very long, and in the short space of time that it has been on the market, it has seen a massive client base. The previous models of the PhotoSmart printer, had become a little old and outdated, and looked like they all required a little renovation. HP then created this printer and upon its release, we have seen a variety of new features such as the LCD screen which is mounted on the printer's external casing. 

This LCD screen has helped the printer reach a new level, and although you may not think that the LCD screen would have such an impact it actually has. With the LCD screen no being a part of the printer, you can now search through the menus and the settings of the printer with ease, as all you have to do is look at the screen as opposed to the more traditional methods of pressing a load of buttons and performing a test print. 

This saves on both printing paper and ink, and will in the long run save you money. There are also appropriate spaces for you to insert your memory card or SD card direct from your camera or computer. This means that the printer can be used as a standalone device and the computer is not needed in order print your images or documents. On top of all these extra new features to the PhotoSmart printer, the fast speeds in which it was able to print, are still maintained and the printer has still been built to last. 

The PhotoSmart D7155 printer still uses the six colour ink cartridge system, which means that the quality of the print is still fantastic. You may think that because the printer uses a total of six ink cartridges that it will cost more money, however this is not the case as the printer will only use the minimum amount of ink required for the print.
