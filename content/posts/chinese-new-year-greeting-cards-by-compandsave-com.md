January 31st, 2014 marks the beginning of a new year, the year of the Horse according to the Chinese calendar. Chinese New Year is about tradition, togetherness, and making way for incoming good fortune. Although this centuries old festivity is a traditional Chinese holiday, Chinese New Year is celebrated in various parts of the world. The celebration usually runs from Chinese New years Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the Lantern Festival on the 15th day of the first month, making it the longest ceremony in the Chinese calendar.
