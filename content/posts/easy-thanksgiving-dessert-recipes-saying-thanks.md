Pumpkin pies, sweet potato pies, cranberry jam, apple crips and towering trifles. These are just a few iconic (and tasty) Thanksgiving treats. Of course, every table is different. Some of us don't favor pumpkin at all. While some will have an assortment of pumpkin-flavored desserts. This is part of the beauty of Thanksgiving. We're not only sharing gratitude, but learning more about each other.

We learned this first-hand when we sent out our Thanksgiving company newsletter. In the letter we asked our customers what their favorite Thanksgiving dessert was. In return we received such lovely and unique responses. Pies were a favorite, especially pumpkin, apple and pecan pies. Empanadas, a pastry often filled with fruit or creme filling, was an uncommon answer. If you haven't had one, try a pumpkin empanada this Thursday. One wonderful customer, Sheila Jargowski, wrote in with some delicious recipes. Cornflake cookies and peaches and cream cheesecake, who can say no that? With her permission, we are sharing them below. 

  
**Peaches and Cream Cheesecake Recipe**

There's a lovely story behind this dessert. Sheila shared that she once baked this cheesecake for her now-husband. The way to the heart is through the stomach, after all. Their 30th wedding anniversary was this week on November 19th. Thanks again Sheila for sharing a beautiful memory and recipe with us.
