There are only 24 hours in a day and sometimes, it's just not enough. With hectic work, family and personal schedules, it can be hard to stay focused on the task at hand. However, with the right apps at your disposal, you can prioritize and schedule your day in a way that can greatly increase productivity!

### Save Articles For Later

The internet is an endless collection of webpages and articles, so it can be easy to get lost and waste a lot of your work time browsing. [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) works across multiple devices and lets you save articles to read for later. Then, when you have some spare time, you can access your list, archive anything you may want to keep and delete any articles that you have read.

### Never Forget A Password

There are some great tools out there for saving you time during the day, one of the best being password manage apps. Extensions such as [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) or [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) can be downloaded to any browser and can shave hours off your workload per year. These extensions will automatically prompt you to save any new passwords and will automatically fill them in for you next time. If you have many different logins across multiple platforms, you can understand how this could save a lot of time and frustration.

### Plan Your Day

If you start your day with a clear and precise list of what your goals are, chances are you will be more likely to accomplish those tasks. Glass Planner can help with that. Glass syncs with your calendar so you can schedule tasks easily into your day. It also gives you the option to turn your calendar into a scheduled list so you can easily see your action plan for the day. You can set priority levels and even better, you will only see the current day's tasks (or future tasks you can act on now) to eliminate unnecessary distractions.

### Track Your Time 

It's easy to lose track of time throughout the day when you are working on important projects. Sometimes so much so, that others things get pushed to the side unintentionally. With an app such as Hours Time Tracking, you can track the time you spend on different projects at work. And don't worry if you are too busy to remember to stop or start a timer, this app has handy reminders that will ping you when necessary.

### Declutter Your Mailbox

It can be frustrating and overwhelming to come in for the day to an inbox so full, it takes two cups of coffee to get through it all. To help distinguish between the junk and the important emails, use an app like [Unroll Me](https://unroll.me/). This lets you easily unsubscribe from emails you do not want to receive, thus cutting down on the clutter and freeing up space for the important stuff.
