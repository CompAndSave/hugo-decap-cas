The HP PhotoSmart 8230 printer is seen as a replacement for a previous model of PhotoSmart printer the 8450\. It maintain the previous models speed and quality in the print, however it now holds updated internal working parts and a new redesigned print engine. Basically rather than using the older tri colour ink system with built in print heads, the new system requires the use of an innovative reservoir system that used six separate ink tanks.

It is still able to provide you with the speedy printing service, and it now includes a smart personal printing lab. This feature is seen as the printer's finest addition and also its best strength gain, as this feature is what makes the PhotoSmart 8230 printer a real force to be reckoned with in the printing industry.
