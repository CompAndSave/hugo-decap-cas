## What Is A Canon Printer?

A Canon printer is a brand of printing devices manufactured by Canon Inc., a Japanese multinational corporation. They make different kinds of printers, such as inkjet, laser, all-in-one (which can print, scan, copy, and sometimes fax), and large-format printers, for both personal and professional use. Canon printers are known for their quality, performance, and advanced features, making them popular for home and office use.



But sometimes, these printers have issues, like not printing correctly. So, how can you make it work again? Let’s find out!

## How To Find A Canon Printer Model?

To properly troubleshoot and repair your Canon printer, you must first know the exact type of Canon printer you have. Let’s help you find and know your printer's model from the methods below:

### Method 1: Examine the Printer

Inspect your printer carefully. The model name or number can be found on the printer's exterior, often on the front, top, near the control panel, or inside the cartridge holder. See the examples below:

### **Method 2: Check the User Manual**

If you haven’t found it in the first option, look inside your printer's user manual for the model name and number. It's usually listed there.

### Method 3: Online Help

If you can't locate it on the printer, visit [Canon's official website](https://www.usa.canon.com/support) or follow this [guide on how to find printer name on your printer](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-find-printer-name).

## Canon Printer Problems And Solutions: Common Issues

Now that you know how to find your printer’s model number, let's discuss the most common Canon printer issues and how to fix them. We'll explore the reasons behind these issues and provide simple solutions to get your printer working smoothly again. Here are some:

### 1. Canon Printer Offline Issue

One of the most common problems that may cause your Canon printer not printing is when it goes offline. When this happens, always check the basics, like a loose power cable, before troubleshooting further. If it still doesn’t work, try reinstalling printer drivers.

#### **A. Canon Printer Not Connecting to Computer**

Your printer can go offline when your printer fails to connect to your computer properly, either wired or wirelessly.

**Wired Connection:**

* Check Cables. Ensure the USB or Ethernet cable is securely connected between the printer and the computer.
* USB Port. Try using a different USB port on your computer.
* Restart Devices. To refresh both systems, turn off the printer and computer and then turn them back on.

**Wireless Connection:**

* Network Check. Confirm that the printer and computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
* Restart Router. Power cycle your router and check for improved connectivity.
* Printer Settings. Access the printer settings to verify the wireless connection.

#### **B. Printer Driver Is Not Working**

Another reason for offline issues is when the printer driver is corrupted. If this happens, you just need to reinstall the drivers. Here’s how:

**FOR WINDOWS:**

**Step 1: Uninstall the printer driver.**

* Open the Control Panel.
* Go to "Devices and Printers."
* Right-click on your Canon printer and select "Remove device."
* Follow the prompts to uninstall the driver.

**Step 2: Reinstall the printer driver.**

* Go to the Canon website.
* Download the latest driver for your printer model.
* Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the new driver.

**FOR MAC:**

**Step 1: Uninstall the printer driver.**

* Open "System Preferences."
* Click on "Printers & Scanners."
* Select your Canon printer and click the minus (-) button to remove it.

**Step 2: Reinstall the printer driver.**

* Go to the Canon website.
* Download the latest driver for your printer model.
* Open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the new driver.

#### **C. Printer's Sleep Mode**

Printers have a sleep mode to save energy when inactive. This makes them slower to respond and can sometimes cause your printer to go offline. To fix this:

* Wake-Up Methods. Press any button on the printer, send a print job, or access the printer's control panel to wake it from sleep mode.
* Adjust Sleep Settings. Modify the printer's sleep settings through the control panel or printer software.
* Power Cycling. Turn the printer off and then back on to reset it and exit sleep mode.

#### **D. Disable Windows Spooler (Only For Windows Users)**

Another way to fix Canon printer offline issues is to disable Windows Spooler. This program temporarily holds print jobs in the computer's memory until the printer is ready, but it can sometimes cause the printer to go offline. So, here are the steps to disable it:

**Step 1: Disable Windows Spooler**

* Open the Start menu and type "services.msc" in the search bar. Press Enter.
* In the Services window, scroll down and find "Print Spooler."
* Right-click on "Print Spooler" and select "Stop" to disable it temporarily.

**Step 2: Access Printer Settings**

* Open the Control Panel from the Start menu.
* Click on "Devices and Printers."

**Step 3: Manage Printer Properties**

* Right-click on your Canon printer and choose "Printer properties."

**Step 4: Navigate to Printer Preferences**

* In the printer properties dialog box, go to the "Ports" tab.

**Step 5: Adjust Spooling Settings**

* Scroll down to the bottom and uncheck the box that says "Enable Printer Spooling."
* Make sure that "Enable bidirectional support" is checked.
