For those of you who enjoy DIY home improvement projects, we have some great tips. First, you can change the layout of your furniture in any room. Sometimes, even the smallest change can make a big difference! One idea is to move the furniture away from the windows to let in more natural light. Another tip is to remove any unnecessary furniture to help make a room look bigger. Simply getting rid of clutter can also make a world of difference. A unique one is 3D printers! Did you know you can use 3D printers to add quirky and interesting touches to your home?

space. Hence, these machines are becoming ever more useful, capable, efficient, versatile and user friendly. While you and I may not be able to 3D print our own homes just yet, there is a lot we can create and customize with the help of 3D printers.

### What you can do right now with your home 3D printers

Joshua Stellini, an artist and student at the University of Melbourne used his imagination and a 3D printer to create a unique two-in-one piece of furniture. He created a table that is also a comfy seat – a 3D table with cushiony, 3D printed seating surfaces. The device helped standardize processes and made labor simpler.

And what can you do with a home 3 D printer? Amazon has home printers like a 3D pen to create doodles in the air. They are abstract masterpieces born out of your own imagination! You can also print fabricated parts using PLA filament, a nontoxic resin made of sugar from field corn. PLA filaments can create customized 3D models of various objects like toys, models and miniatures and more with the bigger machines with better features.

You can also use scanning software to create a digital image of the object you want to create. For example, printing out a miniature of a vintage car (a nostalgic conversation starter!). Creating amusing and unusual toys for kids and grandkids is also another great idea. Another cool project is making one-of-a-kind jewelry. You can also make your own replacement parts and tools to your own required specification.

This article outlines some [really cool household and home improvement items](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/useful-3d-printed-household-items/) you can 3D print. For example: a wine rack, a drink dispenser, a portable combination safe, outlet protectors, unique penholders, bottle openers, coasters, wall mounts or hooks, even a shower head and so much more.
