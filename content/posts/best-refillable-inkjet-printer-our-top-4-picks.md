Printers with refillable ink tanks are a bit different from regular printers. Rather than relying on replaceable ink cartridges, these printers feature large tanks that you can refill with ink when they run low. This design can save you more money on ink as refill bottles are usually cheaper than individual ink cartridges. If you print often and don't want to keep buying expensive cartridges or prefer not to [refill ink cartridges yourself](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-refill-ink-cartridges-guide), refillable ink printers are a smart choice. 

## Inkjet Printer Refill: How to Choose the Best One

Selecting the best refillable printer is important but with so many options available, it can feel overwhelming. To help you make a wise decision, we've compiled a list of [factors you can consider before buying a printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-choose-a-printer-tips-on-selecting-the-best-one-for-you.html):

### 1. Printing Needs

Before you make a decision, think about what you usually print. Do you print a lot of documents, such as school papers or work reports? Or do you enjoy printing photos? Perhaps you do a bit of both.

Understanding your printing habits can greatly assist you in selecting the ideal printer for your needs.

### 2. Cost of Ink

Consider how much it will cost to refill the ink tanks for your printer. While refillable inkjet printers are generally cheaper upfront, it's essential to factor in the ongoing expense of ink bottles to ensure they fit within your budget.

### 4. Print Speed

How fast your printer can print is essential, especially when you have a lot of pages to print. Think about how quickly you need your printer to work.
