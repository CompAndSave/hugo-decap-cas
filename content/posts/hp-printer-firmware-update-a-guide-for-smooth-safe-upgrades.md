Updating your printer doesn’t have to feel risky or confusing. Many users hesitate because they worry an HP printer firmware update might cause issues, or make the [HP cartridge problem](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/hp-cartridge-problem-solve-it-today-with-these-proven-fixes.html) even worse. But the truth is, firmware updates keep your printer running smoothly, fix hidden bugs, and protect it from security risks.

Every HP printer relies on firmware, and knowing how to update HP printer firmware safely helps you avoid failures, errors, or mid-update crashes. Whether you're dealing with a slow printer, Wi-Fi drops, or outdated features, the right update can solve them.

**In this guide, you'll learn:**

* What a printer firmware update actually is
* Why does HP send update prompts
* How to complete a firmware update on an HP printer safely
* How to avoid problems during updates

## **What is an HP Printer Firmware Update?** 

An HP printer firmware update is the printer’s built-in code that controls printing, connectivity, and cartridge recognition. Outdated firmware can trigger the HP cartridge problem and slow down performance. Updating firmware improves reliability, security, and print quality.

### **Difference Between Firmware and Software**

| Firmware | Software |
| --- | --- |
| Built-in internal code that controls printer hardware | Programs or applications that run on the printer or computer |
| Manages printing, wireless connectivity, and cartridge recognition | Updates programs and features, but does not control hardware directly |
| Low-level, controls core printer operations | High-level, affects software behavior only |
| HP firmware update via HP Smart app, printer control panel, or HP website | Software update HP printer via drivers or HP Smart app |


### **What Firmware Controls Inside the Printer**

The firmware governs all core functions of your HP printer. This includes:

* **Cartridge communication:** detecting and verifying cartridges to prevent errors.
* **Connectivity:** ensuring Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or mobile printing works reliably.
* **Print performance:** maintaining quality, speed, and error-free operations.

## **Why HP Printer Firmware Updates Are Necessary**

A firmware update fixes printing issues like the HP cartridge problem, slow performance, and connectivity errors. Knowing why updating HP firmware helps users keep printers stable and secure.

* **Fix Bugs or Printing Errors:** Firmware updates resolve errors such as misaligned prints, unexpected stops, and paper jams. Knowing how to update HP printer firmware ensures these fixes are applied safely.
* **Improve Wi-Fi/Ethernet Connectivity:** Updates optimize network performance and prevent Wi-Fi or Ethernet drops, keeping the printer connected reliably.
* **Ensure Compatibility with HP Smart App Features:** Only updated firmware ensures your printer works with all HP Smart app features, including scanning, mobile printing, and cloud services.
* **Enhance Printer Security:** Firmware strengthens internal security and protects against unauthorized access. Users can disable Firmware updates, but this may reduce protection.
* **HP Cartridge Compatibility Issues:** Some updates may block non-HP or third-party cartridges, causing the HP cartridge problem. Knowing how to install firmware on an HP printer allows safe updates. An [HP printer firmware downgrade](https://www.compandsave.com/hp-printer-firmware-downgrade) can restore compatibility if needed.

## **How to Safely Prepare Before Updating HP Printer Firmware**

Proper preparation prevents errors like the HP cartridge problem or failed installations. Following simple steps ensures a safe firmware update and keeps your printer secure, stable, and fully functional.

### **1. Ensure Reliable Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection**

A stable network is essential for any firmware update on an HP printer. Updates may fail or stall if the Wi-Fi or Ethernet connection drops. For best results, connect directly to a strong and consistent network before proceeding.

### **2. Do Not Turn Off the Printer During the Update**

Interrupting an update can permanently damage your printer. Always keep it powered on until the update completes. This simple precaution helps avoid firmware problems and prevents errors.

### **3. Locate the Printer PIN**

Many HP printers require a PIN during updates. You can find the HP PIN location inside the cartridge access area. Keep this handy before performing a firmware update on an HP printer.

### **4. Confirm Power Stability**

Sudden power outages during firmware updates can cause failures. Ensure your printer is connected to a stable power source, preferably a surge-protected outlet, to avoid interruptions.

### **5. Third-Party Cartridge Awareness**

Some updates may block non-HP cartridges, causing the HP cartridge problem. Knowing how to update HP printer firmware lets you manage updates safely. 

## **How to Update HP Printer Firmware Using the HP Smart App (Most Common Method)**

The easiest way to perform a firmware update is via the HP Smart app. Ignoring updates can cause the HP cartridge problem or printing errors. The app guides you step-by-step for a safe update and helps manage regular firmware updates efficiently.

### **1. Accessing Advanced Settings in HP Smart**

Open the HP Smart app on your device. Select your printer, then go to Advanced Settings. If you don’t see it directly, click **View All → Advanced Settings**. This opens the menu to start the firmware update process.

### **2. HP Printers Firmware Update (Side Menu Layout)**

For printers with a side menu layout:

1. Navigate to **General → Firmware Update → Check for Update**.
2. Enter the printer PIN if prompted. The HP PIN location is usually inside the cartridge access area.
3. Click Update to install any available firmware.

### **3. HP Printers Firmware Update (Top Menu Layout)**

For printers with a top menu layout:

1. Click the Printer Update Tile or go to **Tools → Printer Updates → Firmware Updates.**
2. Enter the printer PIN when prompted.
3. Click Check for Update.
4. If an update is available, click Update to install.

### **4. Safety Notes for HP Smart App Updates**

* Never turn off the printer mid-update; this can damage the device.
* If the update fails, retry using another method or refer to How to install firmware on HP printer guides.
* Users can choose to disable HP printer Firmware update prompts or perform an HP printer firmware downgrade if compatibility issues occur with third-party cartridges.

## **How to Update HP Printer Firmware from the Printer Control Panel**

You can perform an HP printer firmware update directly from the control panel. This method helps fix the HP cartridge problem, improve connectivity, and ensure smooth printing. Knowing how to update HP printer firmware from the printer keeps the process safe and simple.

### **1. Printers With “Menu” Home Screen**
