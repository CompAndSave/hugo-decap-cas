### **Clear Signs Your Printhead Is Clogged**

You don’t need tools to clean the print head. Epson lets you clean Epson print head directly from your computer. Try this quick automatic method before opening the printer.

Epson provides a tool called the Epson Head Cleaning Utility. It works on both Windows and macOS. Follow these steps:

#### **1. Open the Epson Printer Utility**

* **On Windows:**
  Go to Control Panel → Devices and Printers.
  Right-click your Epson printer and select Printing Preferences or Maintenance.
* **On macOS:**
  Go to System Preferences → Printers & Scanners.
  Select your Epson printer, then click Options & Supplies → Utility.

#### **2. Run the “Head Cleaning” or “Clean Print Head” Function**

Once the utility opens, choose Head Cleaning (Windows) or Clean Print Head (Mac).

The cleaning process usually takes 1–2 minutes. Don’t turn off the printer or unplug it during this time.

Before you begin, gather these basic items:

* A lint-free cloth or paper towel
* Distilled water or official Epson ink nozzle cleaning fluid

* Gloves (to keep hands clean)

#### **Manual Cleaning Steps**

1. **Power Off and Unplug:** Safety first. Always turn off and unplug the printer before accessing internal parts.
2. **Open Access Panel Carefully:** Lift the top cover or cartridge bay. Look for the printhead carriage—it may slide to the center once powered off.
3. **Moisten and Wipe Nozzles:** Dampen a lint-free cloth with distilled water. Gently wipe around the printhead nozzles. Avoid scrubbing or pressing hard.
4. **Syringe Flush:** Still having issues? Use a syringe kit to push cleaning fluid through the nozzle ports. This can unclog the Epson printhead manually if the ink is deeply dried inside.
5. **Let It Dry Completely:** After cleaning, leave the printer open for 1–2 hours to dry. Then, reassemble and power it on.
