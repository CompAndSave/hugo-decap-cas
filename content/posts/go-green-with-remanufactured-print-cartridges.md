Recycling has been a part of the printer ink cartridge industry for a long time, by way of remanufactured cartridges. Third party manufacturers restore cartridges from the usual wear and tear and reassemble them as brand-new printer ink cartridges. You can make your office a little more green by using remanufactured cartridges instead of [OEM (original equipment manufacturer) cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/the-best-online-availability-and-prices-on-all-your-oem-printer-cartridge-needs.html).
With remanufactured cartridges, you can conserve plastic and give printer ink cartridges a new life!

**How are remanufactured cartridges green?**

Remanufactured cartridges are cleaned many times with all ink removed. They are then recycled and put together to form a fresh new cartridge. It's a very long process!. Here at [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/), we make sure our remanufactured ink cartridges are of the highest quality, so that we can [guarantee](https://www.compandsave.com/help) that you're getting a good, green product 100 percent of the time.
Remanufactured cartridges are not the same as [refillable cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-refill-bulk-ink/color-3x30ml), which can only be filled with new ink at certain locations. You can even refill cartridges yourself if you have [the right tools](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-refill-bulk-ink/black-3x30ml).

On average, remanufactured cartridges cost 15 to 50% less than OEM cartridges. In some cases, remanufactured ink cartridges print more pages than their big-name counterparts. Not only are remanufactured cartridges recycled, they're more efficient!

Using remanufactured cartridges in place of an OEM cartridge is a great way to reduce your office's environmental impact. We'll find you the best deals on eco-friendly remanufactured printer cartridges!
