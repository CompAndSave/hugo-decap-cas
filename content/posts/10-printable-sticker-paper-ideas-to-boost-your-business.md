It's often the small, simple details that go past us. Yet they can unexpectedly affect your business system for the better.  
  
Stickers can do a lot of things. They're as budget-friendly as they are versatile since you can print multiples in one sticker printer paper. You can put them everywhere to influence an environment, organize your system and make a statement. 

  
Here are ways on how stickers can bolster your biz.

  
1\. Promo Custom Stickers

Who can resist a sticker giveaway when stickers call on childhood memories of fun collectibles and "gold stars"?  
  
Promo Custom Stickers function as mobile marketing to increase your company's brand awareness.   
  
Here are a few tips on printing your Promo Stickers: 
* Sticker giveaways are relatively small, so make sure to grab attention with vivid colors of your theme.
* Be conscious of color meaning and what message you want people to associate you with. Many people think of money and eco-friendliness when they see green. Blue is associated with trust and security. You get the idea.
* If you're promoting a product, your custom stickers' image will show people what it's all about at a glance. If you're selling donuts, let it be a design about donuts. It's okay to get basic while adding a twist of your own.
* Print your design on a glossy sticker printer paper if you want it to have a sophisticated look.
* If you're an artist, promotional custom stickers are one way of sharing your art style to others. People won't be able to resist to use it as decoration.
* Make sure to add in your sticker your social media channel in order to contact you.

2\. Product and Package Label Vinyl Stickers

Packaging adds to a product's aesthetic and a customer's desire to buy them. Package label design is therefore important to upgrading the look of your product. 

  
In sticker printing Product and Package Labels, always remember: 
* Glossy photo sticker paper compliments reflective surfaces such as glass.
* Glossy photo sticker paper adds elegance to a non-reflective surface.
* Matte photo sticker paper gives off a "natural" look.
* If the labels needs to be written upon, matte photo sticker paper is easier to write on. Writing on glossy labels will make the ink smear.

  
3\. Office and Equipment Labels on Printable Sticker Paper
