The HP PhotoSmart C6185 printer is one of the latest printers which have been made available from the Hewlett Packard brand. It is an all in one or multifunctional printer which is able to assist you with not only printing tasks, but also copying, scanning and faxing processes too. If you are looking for a modern replacement for your older printing unit, then this could just be the printer that you have been looking for. 

If you already own this printer, then we have no doubt that you will have nothing but praise for the PhotoSmart range and also the C6185 printer. It has been well known to produce only the finest in quality images and documents when used to print in not only the office workplace, but also in the family home. It is of a very compact size, when you take into consideration the amount of tasks it is able to complete for you. The Price, in which the printer is available to buy, is also very reasonable. 

The PhotoSmart C6185 printer is a printer of the Ink jet origin, this means that the printer requires the use of compatible ink cartridges to make the printer able to complete the requirements you place upon it. This printer uses six ink cartridges, which as you may have noticed is more than other more traditional ink jet printers, which only require the use of four different inks. You may think that this is just further expense, but this is not the case as the use of an extra two ink cartridges, will actually increase the life span of all cartridges involved within the printer. The Quality of the final print is also increased as more attention to the smaller details in the document or image can now be printed.

As with all printers, there will come a time when you need to replace the ink in the system. It is highly recommended that you look to use the compatible ink cartridge types. This is because they come available at a much lower price than the genuine types, and despite this discounted price, there will be no sacrifice when it comes to the quality of the final print. Genuine types of cartridge are always going to be the manufactures number one choice and these are always the types of cartridge that will be recommended to you, when you buy the printer. However these are expensive and if you use your printer on a regular or daily basis then using genuine ink cartridges will become expensive.
