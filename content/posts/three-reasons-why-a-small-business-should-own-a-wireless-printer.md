Small businesses need to be money-smart when first starting out. Between the pressure to turn a profit and constant need for [the right resources](https://www.compandsave.com/), a wireless printer might seem like too big of an investment for a small business. But it doesn't have to be!

Small Businesses Need As Much Space As Possible
A wireless printer will maximize your small business's square footage. Cables that tangle can create a potentially dangerous mess, plus the constantly swapping out connections between computers and the printer can clutter your office in no time.

No longer do you need to be physically close to the printer to use it — with a wireless printer, you or your employees can send images or documents to the printer from almost any location in your office's [wireless network](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/?ql=3#fbid=5asLy7ab6ZI).

Speedy Printing Speeds Up Your Business

Wireless printers cut down on physical setup time. Any worker within the small business's network can [share the printer](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/how-to-make-printer-wireless), eliminating the time needed for shifting around and physically hooking up a printer.


Workers with smartphones and tablets can now print from a company wireless printer, even if they're on a business trip! All you need is the right app, and you can print something at the office any time you want.
