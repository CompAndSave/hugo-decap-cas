When it comes to printing, the terminology can be confusing. What exactly is the difference between toner and ink? Are they interchangeable? Is there a difference between laser and inkjet printers? Remanufactured-what!? Considering the cost of printing, your best strategy is understanding exactly what each term means and where you can save money without sacrifices quality. The following is a quick glossary to help you navigate your company's next printing purchase.

**Toner:** A carbon-polymer powder mix used in laser printers and copy machines to form the text and images on a print out. A fuser melts the toner and binds it to the paper.

**[Printer Ink cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/):** Also known as an inkjet cartridge, the printer ink cartridge is a replaceable ink component of an inkjet printer. The printer uses hear to transfer the ink from the cartridge to the page.

**OEM Cartridge:** Stands for Original Equipment Manufacturer cartridge. These name brand cartridges are produced by the printer manufacturing companies, such as Canon, Hewlett Packard or Lexmark. You pay a brand premium for OEM cartridges.

**Compatible cartridge:** Compatible cartridges are non-recycled, generic versions of OEM cartridges. They are a portion of the cost of the OEM cartridges and are typically of very high quality.

**Remanufactured cartridge:** A recycled printer cartridge. If the manufacturer adheres to the Quality Assurance system known as ISO-9000, these cartridges are of equal quality to OEM cartridges. They can even be used for graphic design. Remanufactured cartridges will save you between 50 and 75% on ink costs, with even greater savings when you buy [discount cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/) in bulk.

**Laser printer:** An "electrostatic" printer that uses laser beam to transfer toner to paper thus creating the text and images.

**Inkjet printer:** A computer printer that reproduces a digital image by propelling variably-sized droplets of liquid via heat (which makes the liquid bubble and splatter) onto a page.

**Printhead:** Used to deliver the ink to the page that you are printing, the printhead is vitally important to your print quality (never touch a printhead!) and can wear out over time.

**Nozzles:** Many nozzles or "jets" are located on the printhead. These nozzels heat and cool the ink inside the cartridge so that ink can be moved onto the paper.
