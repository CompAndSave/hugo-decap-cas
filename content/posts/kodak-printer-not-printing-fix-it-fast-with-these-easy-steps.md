Many users report their Kodak printer not printing or failing mid-job due to setup errors, connection issues, or overheating. Before assuming it’s a major hardware fault, check these top reasons why your Kodak printer won’t print.

If you use an ink-based Kodak model, cartridge issues can stop printing.

Using low quality ink cartridges can lead to quality issues or printer errors.

The Kodak printer has a safety feature that halts printing when it overheats. If you’ve been printing multiple photos back-to-back, let it cool for a few minutes before trying again. Overheating is temporary and not a sign that the Kodak printer is not working permanently.
