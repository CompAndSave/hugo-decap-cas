It is an observance that started out as Decoration Day, a day to honor the Union and Confederate soldiers of the American Civil War. Memorial Day as we know it today, is a solemn occasion, but also a festive one. Honored on the last Monday of every May, this is the day we give thanks and celebrate the lives of all the soldiers who died in service of the nation.

While many of us honor a family member or family friend by laying flowers on their grave, others among us volunteer to show your respect by laying the national flag upon the graves of soldiers in national cemeteries. We at [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/)honor our fallen heroes via this special Memorial Day Post.

### Some Suggestions for this Memorial Day

Memorial Day falls on May 25th this year. Here are some suggestions to join in the celebrations this year:

**Memorial Day in Washington DC** â€“ You could plan a visit at this time to join in various events such as:

* The National Memorial Day Concert on Sunday, May 24th which will feature Joe Mantegna and Gary Sinise, and other guest artists along with the National Symphony Orchestra
