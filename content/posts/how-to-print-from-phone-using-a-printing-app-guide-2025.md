### **1. Ensure a Stable Network Connection**

Make sure your phone and printer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network unless using a remote printing feature like HP Print Anywhere or Epson Email Print. A strong connection reduces errors and keeps print jobs moving smoothly.

### **2. Check and Adjust Printer Settings**

Before sending large print jobs, double-check paper size, orientation, and print quality. Apps like Canon PRINT, HP Smart, and Brother iPrint&Scan allow you to adjust these settings in-app—avoiding wasted paper, ink, and time.

For important documents or multiple photos, print a single page first to confirm settings. Send one job at a time for large batches—this prevents printer overload, especially when printing from cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox.

### **5. Keep Devices Updated and in a Good Location**

Keep your printer firmware and mobile app updated to avoid compatibility issues. Place your printer in a spot with a strong Wi-Fi signal and enough space to prevent paper jams or overheating, ensuring smooth wireless printing every time.
