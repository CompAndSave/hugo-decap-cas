Recently, HP released a new firmware update to Inkjet printers. These new versions are firmware 2151A for printers using HP 962/962XL ink and firmware 2151B for printers using HP 910/910XL ink cartridges.

Printer industries regularly release new versions of printer firmware to fix bug issues, enhancements, or app updates. However, if you are using an aftermarket printer cartridge, this might not be the case as the new update will also make your printer not recognize third-party ink. But the good news is that CompAndSave’s ink cartridge chip for these models is now compatible with the latest firmware version.

## Which printers and printer cartridges are affected by this new HP firmware update?

**1. Printers using HP 962/962XL ink cartridges**

* HP OfficeJet Pro 9010 All-in-One
* HP OfficeJet Pro 9020 All-in-One

**2. Printers using HP 910/910XL ink cartridges**

* HP OfficeJet Pro 8020 All-in-One

These new printer firmware updates target the printers and ink cartridges we have listed above. You might have recently noticed a message on your printer screen that your printer’s firmware has been updated as printer industries can do this automatically, without your consent or prompting, especially if your printer is connected to your WiFi.

## What will happen if my printer is affected by this update?

If you use any of the printers mentioned above, there is nothing to worry about as our ink cartridges’ chip will now be recognized by the latest firmware. To avoid future updates and if you wish to still use third-party ink cartridges, we strongly suggest turning off the automatic firmware update feature of your printer which will be discussed in the later part of this page.

## How to check my printer firmware version?

If your printer firmware has been updated, your firmware version should be 2151A for printers using HP 962/962XL ink or 2151B for printers using HP 910/910XL ink cartridges. If you are unsure if your printer has been updated to its latest firmware version or not, kindly follow the steps below:

**STEP 1:** Find the setup icon on the control panel.
