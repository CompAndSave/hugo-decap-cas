Each October, the National Breast Cancer Foundation, Inc.® (NBCF) uses Breast Cancer Awareness Month to [increase understanding of the disease](https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/breast-cancer-awareness-month/). The foundation also supports vital research projects that seek to develop advanced personalized therapies and improve the outcome of breast cancer. [CompAndSave.com](https://www.compandsave.com) is proud to be donating proceeds of sales this month to NBCF. 

## Better Treatment Options for a Devastating Type of Cancer 

We often think of breast cancer as monolithic. But it is not just one disease. It's actually a group of various diseases defined by combinations of receptors, which tell cells to carry out specific actions. 

Currently, NBCF funds targeted research of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). About 10-20% percent of all breast cancers are diagnosed as TNBC. Patients need more treatment options because this type of cancer can be difficult to treat. 

## Why Is TNBC Different Than Other Breast Cancers? 

Doctors treat most breast cancers by targeting three receptors: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The name of TNBC arises from the fact that the tumor is ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-negative. This means that doctors can't manage the tumor the same way as other cancers. While TNBC does respond to chemotherapy, it is often very aggressive and recurring. 

##  Cutting-Edge Research Supported by NBCF 

In 2015, NBCF backed [two ongoing programs](https://www.nationalbreastcancer.org/nbcf-programs/breast-cancer-research) focused on this complex cancer. Dr. Khandan Keyomarsi is leading a study in Africa to determine if two potential biomarkers could be used as prognostic indicators for TNBC. 

A team at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center is also working to improve treatment and clinical outcomes for both TNBC and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Recent studies point to major similarities in the underlying molecular events that cause these two rare, aggressive cancers. 

Survivor Delia Stroud participated in this life-saving program: "A standard triple-negative chemo regimen is 12 weeks of taxol, followed by four doses of adriamycin and cytoxan. In the new study, doctors gave patients an additional chemo drug called carboplatin. … I finished my chemotherapy at the end of June. The tumors responded the way we had hoped."
