### Method #1 - How to Use Bluetooth Printer with Android

Although only a handful of printers support Bluetooth connectivity nowadays, it's a more straightforward way to print from Android than using Wi-Fi networks. The process is quite simple. If you have ever connected your wireless earbuds or speakers to your phone via Bluetooth, then you'll know how to print from an Android phone via Bluetooth.



### How to Connect Bluetooth Printer to Android Phone

1. To start Bluetooth printing from Android, turn on the Bluetooth Scanning option on your printer. Different brands have different ways of doing this, so make sure to check the instruction manual to know how to add printer to Android phone.
2. Once the printer is scanning for devices, go to your Android phone's settings, then Connected Devices, and then click on Pair New Devices.
3. If there is no option for pairing, then there will be a scanner searching for Bluetooth devices nearby to start printing from Android device.
4. Let it do its searching, and your printer should show up in scanned devices under its default name. Tap on its name to connect printer to Android phone.



***Note:** Make sure to keep the mobile close to the printer, as Bluetooth doesn't have a very high range. Also, if you close the Bluetooth, either from the printer or the mobile, it will disconnect. So make sure not to do this mid-printing.*

NFC Connection: Some printers also feature an NFC connection (Near Field Communication), which makes it even easier and faster to connect Android to Bluetooth. Look for an NFC mark on the front or side of your printer if it supports an NFC connection.



If you find it, turn on NFC on your phone and tap it on the printer where the NFC mark is. This should automatically connect Android phone to the printer via Bluetooth.
