## Print From Android To Printer: 3 Advantages

An Android phone is a smartphone that uses the Android operating system developed by Google. While you can use it primarily for communication, it also offers the convenience of printing. Printing from an Android device is easy and helps you work more efficiently, making it a versatile tool for personal and professional tasks. Additionally, here are some advantages of using Android phones when printing:

### 1. Convenience

You can print from anywhere, at any time, without needing a computer. Whether at home, in the office, or traveling, you can simply open the document or photo on your phone and send it to a nearby printer. With Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect your phone to a printer and start printing immediately, saving time and effort.

### 2. Easy Setup

Many printers have easy setup options like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, making it simple to connect your Android phone. Printer apps also guide you through the setup so you can start printing quickly. This makes it easy to begin printing from your Android device without much trouble.

### 3. Flexibility For Multiple Users

Multiple users can use the same printer when printing from their Android devices. Each user can send their print jobs to the printer, allowing everyone to print their documents efficiently without needing separate printers. This makes it convenient for shared workspaces or homes where several people need to print different things.

## How Do I Print From My Android Phone: 4 Methods To Try

Now that we've covered some advantages of printing from Android devices, let's explore how to print from Android phone easily. You can try four methods: print via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB cable, or use Papercut Mobility. Let’s discuss each of these methods below.

### Method #1 - Print Using Bluetooth Connectivity

Although only a handful of printers support Bluetooth connectivity nowadays, it's a more straightforward way to print from phone than Wi-Fi networks. The process is quite simple. If you have ever connected your wireless earbuds or speakers to your phone via Bluetooth, then you'll know how to print from an Android phone via Bluetooth. 

Following the steps below, connect your Android device to a Bluetooth printer and start printing.

**Step 1: Turn On Bluetooth on the Printer**

Enable Bluetooth on your printer. Check the instruction manual for specific steps, as different brands may have different methods.

**Step 2: Enable Bluetooth on Your Android Device**

Go to your Android phone's settings. Navigate to "Connected devices" or "Bluetooth" and turn on Bluetooth.

**Step 3: Pair the Devices**

On your Android device, go to "Connected devices" and select "Pair new device," or wait for the device to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices. When your phone detects the printer, select the printer's name from the list of available devices.

**Step 4: Complete the Pairing Process**

Enter the printer's PIN code to complete the pairing process if prompted. This code is usually found in the printer's manual or on the printer itself

**Step 5: Verify the Connection**

Once paired, ensure that the printer is connected to your Android device. You may see the printer listed under paired devices

**Step 6: Print Your Document**

Open the document or file you want to print on your Android device. Select the print option, choose the paired Bluetooth printer, and confirm any print settings before sending the print job.

***Note:** Keep the mobile close to the printer, as Bluetooth doesn't have a high range. Also, if you close the Bluetooth, either from the printer or the mobile, it will disconnect. So make sure not to do this mid-printing.*

*NFC Connection: Some printers also feature an NFC connection (Near Field Communication), which makes it even easier and faster to connect Android to Bluetooth. Look for an NFC mark on the front or side of your printer if it supports an NFC connection. If you find it, turn on **NFC** on your phone and tap it on the printer where the NFC mark is. This should automatically connect the Android phone to the printer via Bluetooth.*

How to print from Android phone to wireless printer? This one is done in a number of ways, but we'll focus on two: Android Default Print Service and Printer's Mobile App

**Add Printer to Android Via Wi-Fi - Default Print Service**

Almost all major printer brands, like Brother, HP, Dell, Canon, and Epson, offer wireless printing for Android phones. You can use Android's default print function or the printer's app. 

Here's how to print from phone using Wi-Fi:

**Step 1: Ensure Same Wi-Fi Network**

Connect both your Android device and the printer to the same Wi-Fi network. If you have multiple Wi-Fi connections, your device may automatically connect to the one with the best signal strength, while your printer may be connected to a different one. Ensure they are connected to the same network.

**Step 2: Access Settings**

Go to your Android phone's settings menu. Use the search bar in the settings menu to find "Printing" and select it from the suggestions.

**Step 3: Enable Default Print Service**

Select "Default Print Service" (or "System Printing Service" on some devices) and turn it on. This will activate the service to scan for compatible printers on the network.

**Step 4: Select Your Printer**

A list of compatible printers connected to the same Wi-Fi network should appear. Select your printer model from this list. If your printer does not appear in the list, you can manually add it by tapping the three-dot menu icon or plus button and selecting "Add Printer." You can then choose to add the printer via Wi-Fi Direct or by entering its IP address.

**Step 5: Confirm Connection**

Once you've selected your printer, ensure it is correctly connected and ready for use. You can now print documents, photos, and web pages directly from your Android device.

**What If It Doesn't Detect the Printer? Add Printer to Android Using Printer's Mobile App:**

If your Android device does not detect your printer, you can use the printer's mobile app to connect and print. Here are the steps to follow:

**Step 1: Access Printing Settings**

Go to your Android device's settings menu. Search for "Printing" and select it from the results.

**Step 2: Navigate to Default Print Service**

Select "Default Print Service" or "System Printing Service" and toggle the switch to "On" if it's not already enabled.

**Step 3: Check for Available Printers**

If your printer is not listed, tap the three-dot menu icon or plus button in the top right and select "Add service" or "Add printer".

**Step 4: Download Printer App**

This will take you to the Google Play Store. Here, you can find and download the app for your printer's brand (e.g., Brother, HP, Dell, Canon, Epson).

**Step 5: Install and Open the App**

Download and install the app from the Google Play Store. Open the app and follow the prompts to allow necessary permissions.

**Step 6: Scan for Printer**

Open the printer settings again and select the newly installed app. Turn on the app and let it scan for your printer. It should now detect your printer.

***Alternative: Use Third-Party Apps***

*If the manufacturer's app does not work, you can try third-party printer applications like PrintShare Mobile Print from the Google Play Store.*

### Method #3 - Print From Android Phone via USB

This is also one of the most popular ways to print from Android phones, but it is not as easy as printing via Bluetooth. This is because you must install an app and buy an OTG device to connect the printer to an Android phone.

[![OTG](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-31-at-1.32.26 pm.png "OTG")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-08-31-at-1.32.26 pm.png)

Following these steps, you can successfully learn how to connect printer to Android phone via USB using an OTG device and print your documents:

**Step 1: Determine USB Port Type**

Check which [type of USB port](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360057266471/different-usb-types-usb-ports-and-usb-connectors-guide) your phone has (e.g., USB-C, USB mini A, USB mini B, USB Micro A/B).

**Step 2: Purchase OTG Device**

Buy an OTG (On-The-Go) adapter that matches your phone's USB port type. This adapter will have a USB A port for the printer cable and a connector for your phone.         

**Step 3: Connect USB Cable to Printer and OTG Device**

Connect the USB B end of the printer cable to the printer. Next, connect the USB A end of the printer cable to the OTG device. Then, connect the OTG device to your phone.

**Step 4: Download and Install NokoPrint App**

Go to the Google Play Store and download the NokoPrint app. Alternatively, you can use the PrintShare Mobile Print app if NokoPrint does not work.

**Step 5: Enable OTG Settings**

Go to your phone's settings, navigate to additional settings, and scroll down to find the OTG settings. Turn on the OTG settings if available. If not, proceed to the next step.

**Step 6: Install Printer Drivers**

Once you connect the OTG device to your phone, you will get a pop-up from NokoPrint asking you to install printer drivers. Press OK and follow the prompts to select your printer and install its driver.

**Step 7: Start Printing**

After installing the drivers, you can start printing directly from your Android phone using the NokoPrint app.
