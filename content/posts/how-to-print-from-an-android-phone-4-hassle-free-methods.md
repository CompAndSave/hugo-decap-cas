## How Do I Print From My Android Phone: 4 Methods To Try

Now that we've covered some advantages of printing from Android devices, let's explore how to print from Android phone easily. You can try four methods: print via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, USB cable, or use Papercut Mobility. Let’s discuss each of these methods below.

### Method #1 - Print Using Bluetooth Connectivity

Although only a handful of printers support Bluetooth connectivity nowadays, it's a more straightforward way to print from phone than Wi-Fi networks. The process is quite simple. If you have ever connected your wireless earbuds or speakers to your phone via Bluetooth, then you'll know how to print from an Android phone via Bluetooth. 

Following the steps below, connect your Android device to a Bluetooth printer and start printing.

**Step 1: Turn On Bluetooth on the Printer**

Enable Bluetooth on your printer. Check the instruction manual for specific steps, as different brands may have different methods.

**Step 2: Enable Bluetooth on Your Android Device**

Go to your Android phone's settings. Navigate to "Connected devices" or "Bluetooth" and turn on Bluetooth.

**Step 3: Pair the Devices**

On your Android device, go to "Connected devices" and select "Pair new device," or wait for the device to scan for nearby Bluetooth devices. When your phone detects the printer, select the printer's name from the list of available devices.

**Step 4: Complete the Pairing Process**

Enter the printer's PIN code to complete the pairing process if prompted. This code is usually found in the printer's manual or on the printer itself

**Step 5: Verify the Connection**

Once paired, ensure that the printer is connected to your Android device. You may see the printer listed under paired devices

**Step 6: Print Your Document**

Open the document or file you want to print on your Android device. Select the print option, choose the paired Bluetooth printer, and confirm any print settings before sending the print job.

***Note:** Keep the mobile close to the printer, as Bluetooth doesn't have a high range. Also, if you close the Bluetooth, either from the printer or the mobile, it will disconnect. So make sure not to do this mid-printing.*

*NFC Connection: Some printers also feature an NFC connection (Near Field Communication), which makes it even easier and faster to connect Android to Bluetooth. Look for an NFC mark on the front or side of your printer if it supports an NFC connection. If you find it, turn on **NFC** on your phone and tap it on the printer where the NFC mark is. This should automatically connect the Android phone to the printer via Bluetooth.*
