The HP PhotoSmart printer has been one of the most review printers of all time; we ask the question why this is? And just why are HP able to keep on releasing the highest quality printers in the market today. Hewlett Packard have been standing proud at the top of the market for several years now, and despite stiff competition they always seem to bring out the latest technology, to use with our family home or office printer. 

The aim of this article is to make you aware of the qualities that printers manufactured from HP possess, and also to help you understand how you can use them within your family home. It does not matter what you are looking for in a printer, HP will have a printer that will be able to help you or fulfil your needs and requirements. If you need a printer to print high quality images then the PhotoSmart series will be the type of printer you are looking for. They have been specifically designed to print only the best images, and all printers, within the range will leave you with a sense of satisfaction, due to the small amount of money you are expected to pay for the printer. 

The PhotoSmart printer is not only able to print images; it will also print all documents you require at an exceptional speed. This also makes the printer ideal for use in offices or in the home office. After using a wide variety of printers from HP, I can truly say that the PhotoSmart printers, I have worked with in the past have been a pleasure to use. I have never encountered any real issues or problems with the printer, and any small issues such as a paper jam can be easily rectified, die to the design of the external case of the printer. 

The Printer that I currently use is the HP PhotoSmart C7250 Printer. This printer is one of the latest models available from HP at this current time, and it has been put through a tough test, as I use it for a variety of prints. It has been used on a daily basis and as with the rest of the printer I have used from HP, I have not encountered any major issues. If there was one piece of advice that I would pass on to you, it would be to use a compatible ink cartridges once your ink supply runs low. Using the compatible ink cartridge has saved me much money in the past, and I have noticed that there is no difference in the quality that my printer is able to produce.
