The main difference between toner and ink cartridges is function. Though both are used in printers, they are not interchangeable. Both are high quality and are used to print documents and photos but they differ in the methods used to set print on paper. From this article, you will learn about the differences between toner and ink as well as some tips for which type to consider based on your needs.

**Toner**

Laser printers use toner cartridges. In a toner cartridge, the light, powder substance is transferred to paper through an electrostatically charged drum unit. They do not directly press the toner powder onto the paper. Instead, the laser draws an electrostatic template of the image onto a rotating metal drum inside the printer. It then alters the electrical charge in certain spots according to data fed from the computer. A drum is coated with a magnetically charged toner. A sheet of paper is then rolled past the drum and draws on the toner. 

**Ink**

Inkjet printers, on the other hand, use ink cartridges. The process here is a bit more straightforward: The liquid ink is sealed tight in a compartment. It is then distributed across the paper by a number of tiny nozzles. The end result is the programmed image set on the paper in dried ink. 

These are some of the technical differences between the two, but as a consumer your main concern will be with performance, value, and price:

**Deciding Which to Use** 

The decision to purchase a laser printer or an inkjet printer will depend largely on the kind of work you anticipate doing. High-end work such as graphic design and high-quality document production can best be done using a laser printer. If your job requires high volume printing, then you are probably better off with an inkjet printer. 

If you are in a job that can be done using either type of machine, then you should consider the replacement cost of each type of cartridge:

Toner cartridges tend to be very expensive; inkjet cartridges less so. This all depends, of course, on the quality of what you buy. Toner will cost you more in the short-term, but the best cartridges last for quite a long time. You may save some money with an inkjet printer, as far as the cost of your inkjet cartridges. But over time a pattern will emerge. Inkjet cartridges do not print as many pages as toner cartridges. They must be replaced more frequently. 

It is possible to find toner and inkjet refill kits, but putting them together and going through the actual process of refilling your cartridges can be a hassle. You may be forced to expend time that you do not have on a job that is of marginal value. 

So, despite their technical differences, toner and ink cartridges are both effective and high quality means of printing. By knowing how they work and what they are best used for, you can determine what time of printer, and therefore, what type of cartridge, will be the one you ultimately choose for your tasks.
