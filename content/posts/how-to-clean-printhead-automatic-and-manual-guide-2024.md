## What Does a Printhead Look Like?

A printhead usually looks like a small block with tiny openings. It's a crucial part of printers that puts ink on the paper. The appearance can vary based on the type and model of the printer. 



Black and tri-color cartridges that are box-types, such as [HP 61](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/61xl-ink-cartridges/ch563wn-ch564wn-3-combo) to 67 series and [Canon 245, 246 series](https://www.compandsave.com/canon/245-246-ink-cartridges-pg-245-cl-246-2-combo), have built-in printheads. Most individual rectangular ink cartridges, like the [HP 952](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/952xl-ink-cartridges/952xl-4-combo) series and [Epson 252](https://www.compandsave.com/epson/252xl-ink-cartridges/t252xl-6-combo), don't have built-in printheads. You can find the printhead once you uninstall all the ink cartridges. Remove the cartridge carrier, then flip it over to see the printhead nozzles at the back. See the examples below:

### Ink Cartridges with Integrated Printhead

## Printhead Cleaning: Signs of a Clogged Printhead

Are you ready to unclog your printhead? But before we know how to clean printhead, let's check out a few signs that might tell you if your printhead is clogged. Some things to look for include:

### 1. Poor Image Quality

A clogged printhead can mess up how your images look. They might seem distorted, blurry, or lacking detail because the ink isn't spreading right due to the blockage. This can be bad if you want to print vibrant photos at home.

### 2. Print Gaps and Lines

Clogs in the printhead can make gaps or lines in your prints. This is because the ink isn't spreading properly across the page, leaving empty spaces or lines.

### 3. Ink Smudges

If you see streaks or ink marks on your prints that shouldn't be there, it might be a sign of a clogged printhead. The blockage makes extra ink build-up, creating marks on the paper.

### 4. Printing Takes Too Long

If your printer is slower than usual, it might be because the printhead is clogged and might need printhead cleaning. The blockage makes the ink struggle through the nozzles, slowing the printing.

### 5. Strange Noises When Printing

Hearing weird sounds like clicks or whirrs while your printer works could mean the printhead is clogged. The blockage makes the printer work harder, causing unusual sounds.



That's why knowing how to clean your printer heads is essential to get the best out of your printer and cartridges. So, let's check out the steps below on how to unclog a printhead.
