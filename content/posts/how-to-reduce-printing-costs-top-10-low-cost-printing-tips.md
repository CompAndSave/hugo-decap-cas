Do you spend a significant chunk of money on printing each year and wonder how to reduce printing costs? If so, you're not alone. Keeping a printer in your home or office can be expensive, but there are many ways to achieve low-cost printing.

In this post, we'll share 10 ways to achieve a lower cost of printing that will help you save money in the long run. From saving ink to finding creative ways to reduce paper usage, we've got you covered. So that said, let's dive right in and find ways to reduce printing costing.

## Top 10 Low-cost Printing Tips

With the right tips and tricks, you can significantly reduce your printing costs. Enjoy bigger savings with our top 10 low-cost printing tips.

### TIP #1 - Use Grayscale Printing Mode

The first tip on our top ten list to reduce the cost of printing is to use grayscale when you want to print something in black and white. This is because the printer uses various inks to create black color instead of directly using black ink. So, use grayscale to lower printing costs, and use the black cartridge in the first place. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to **Devices and Printers** from your Windows **Control Panel**
2. Select your printer and right-click on it
3. Go to **Printing Preferences.**
4. Click on the **Color** tab
5. Click on **Print in Grayscale.**
6. Click **Apply.** Your printer should use grayscale mode now.

### Tip #2 - Set Lower Print Density

Reducing print density is an excellent way to save money on printing. Print density is how dark you want your printouts to be. Unless necessary, you can lower the settings so it won't use more ink. The print density settings can be adjusted on both the inkjet and laser printers.

Here's how to reduce print density to save money on printer ink:

1. Go to the application's print menu (MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Select the device you are using and then click **Preferences**
3. You will see **Quality Settings** of the printed sheet. Click on **Advanced Settings.**
4. Select **Settings List** in the **Advanced Settings** dialog box, then go to **Toner Density**, choose **Adjust**, and click **Details.**
5. Adjust the density of each color and click **OK** when done.

Play around with different density settings until you find one that results in low price printing while still producing high quality or at least acceptable quality prints.
