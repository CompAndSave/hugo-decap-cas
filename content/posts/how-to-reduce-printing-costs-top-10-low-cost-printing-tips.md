## Printing Cost: Common Mistakes That Waste Expensive Materials

Printing can be more expensive than you think, not just because of ink and paper costs but also due to simple mistakes. These small mistakes add up over time, making your printing costs much higher than they need to be. You can save money on printing costs by being more careful and avoiding these common errors: 

* Skipping the print preview and then printing the wrong pages
* Printing too many copies that aren’t needed
* Using high-quality settings for regular prints
* Printing in color when it's not needed
* Ignoring low ink warnings and running out of ink while printing can waste paper and ink, especially if only half the page is printed and you must print it again
* Not updating printer drivers that can cause errors in printing

## How To Reduce Printing Costs: 5 Tips You Can Follow

Now that we know some common printing mistakes, here are some ways to help you how to reduce printing costs. Check out our 5 tips on how to do this:

### Tip #1 - Preview and Proofread

Previewing and proofreading your document before printing is a simple but effective way to lower printing costs. By checking your content first, you can spot any typos or mistakes and ensure everything looks just right, saving you from wasting paper and ink on errors.

Furthermore, the print preview feature lets you identify any layout issues or dimensions that need adjusting before printing. Doing this in advance will avoid wasting pages on unnecessary changes later in the process. If you have a small printing business, you can achieve low-cost printing services by proofreading all the time.

To preview printing on both Windows and Mac, you can follow these steps:

**On Windows (Using Microsoft Office)**

**Step 1:** Open your document in a Microsoft Office application (e.g., Word, Excel, PowerPoint).

**Step 2:** Go to the File menu and select Print (or press CTRL+P). In the print dialog, you will see a preview of your document. This is often combined with the print settings in the same window.

**Step 3:** Use the zoom slider to adjust the preview size if the text is too small to read. Click the arrow at the bottom of the preview to navigate through the pages.

You can also adjust other print settings, such as the number of copies, page orientation, and specific pages to print under the Settings section.

**Step 4:** If you need to make changes, click the File tab again to return to your document.

**Step 5:** When ready, click “Print” to send the job to the printer.

**On Mac (Using Preview)**

**Step 1:** Open your PDF or image in the Preview app.

**Step 2:** To see the thumbnails of all pages, choose View > Thumbnails. To print only selected pages, Command-click the thumbnails of the pages you want to print. Step 3: Choose File > Print to open the print dialog.

**Step 4:** Adjust print options such as scaling, auto-rotating, and including notes if applicable.

**Step 5:** Click Print to send the job to the printer.

### Tip #2 - Use Grayscale Printing Mode

Use grayscale when you want to print something in black and white. Printers often use multiple ink colors to create black, which can waste ink. Using grayscale helps you save on ink costs and ensures you use your black ink cartridge more effectively.

Here's how to do it for both Windows and Mac:

**Step 1:** Open the Print Dialog. Go to File > Print (or press CTRL+P on Windows or Command + P on Mac).

**Step 2:** In the print settings, look for an option like "Print in Grayscale" or "Black and White." Select this option.

**Step 3:** Make any other necessary adjustments, such as selecting the correct printer and choosing the pages to print.

**Step 4:** Click Print to send the job to the printer.
