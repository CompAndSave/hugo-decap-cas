Do you spend a significant chunk of money on printing each year and wonder how to reduce printing costs? If so, you're not alone. Keeping a printer in your home or office can be expensive, but there are many ways to achieve low-cost printing.

## Top 10 Low-cost Printing Tips

With the right tips and tricks, you can significantly reduce your printing costs. Enjoy bigger savings with our top 10 low-cost printing tips.

### TIP #1 - Use Grayscale Printing Mode

The first tip on our top ten list to reduce the cost of printing is to use grayscale when you want to print something in black and white. This is because the printer uses various inks to create black color instead of directly using black ink. So, use grayscale to lower printing costs, and use the black cartridge in the first place. Here's how to do it:

1. Go to **Devices and Printers** from your Windows **Control Panel**
2. Select your printer and right-click on it
3. Go to **Printing Preferences.**
4. Click on the **Color** tab
5. Click on **Print in Grayscale.**
6. Click **Apply.** Your printer should use grayscale mode now.

### Tip #2 - Set Lower Print Density

Reducing print density is an excellent way to save money on printing. Print density is how dark you want your printouts to be. Unless necessary, you can lower the settings so it won't use more ink. The print density settings can be adjusted on both the inkjet and laser printers.

Here's how to reduce print density to save money on printer ink:

1. Go to the application's print menu (MS Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Photoshop, etc.)
2. Select the device you are using and then click **Preferences**
3. You will see **Quality Settings** of the printed sheet. Click on **Advanced Settings.**
4. Select **Settings List** in the **Advanced Settings** dialog box, then go to **Toner Density**, choose **Adjust**, and click **Details.**
5. Adjust the density of each color and click **OK** when done.

Play around with different density settings until you find one that results in low price printing while still producing high quality or at least acceptable quality prints.

### Tip #3 - Use Shorter Margins

One of the most straightforward ways to save on printing costs is by reducing margins on your documents. By default, Microsoft Word sets 1.25 inch margins, which can lead to a lot of wasted paper if not used properly.

Budget printing uses less paper. It's advisable to reduce margins to 0.75 inches. Doing so will free up enough room for you to print more words per page and save more on paper. Strict margin measurements are applicable for academic assignments such as research papers or essays. For other stuff, feel free to adjust.

### Tip #4 - Make Use of Duplex Printing

Duplex printing is a great way to print low cost. It allows you to print both sides of the same sheet. By printing on both sides of the page, you can reduce the amount of paper used and reduce your page cost by 50%. However, not all printers have the capability, so make sure to check your manual.

Printers with duplex printing also have an automatic feature that switches between pages for you, so you just need to press the multi-page printing button and let it do the rest! This saves time and hassle since you don't have to remove the sheet from the printer and change it over to the other side. Another great tip for low price printing!

### Tip #5 - Save Files to PDF

One of the ways to reduce printing and copying costs is by saving files to PDF. The modern era has already moved to digital space, so it's preferred by many people to share PDFs instead of hard copies. Copying files manually is not only time-consuming but also wastes ink and paper that could be put to better use.

Many people are already using PDFs as their preferred format for sharing documents online - so this might just be the best solution all around! Only print out the documents when it's essential- for instance, if you are sending a document to someone else who needs a printed version immediately. Digital copies are such a simple way to achieve inexpensive printing.

Here's how to save a file to PDF:

1. Click "File" in the upper left.
2. Scroll down and choose **Save As.** Other tools use **Download** or **Export.**
3. Save it as PDF or Download/ Export as PDF.
4. Choose a destination drive or folder.
