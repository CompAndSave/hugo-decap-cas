## Why is my Brother Printer Offline? The Possible Cause

Before we dig into the solution, you must know why your Brother printer is offline. Here are some of the reasons:

* Cable connectivity issues
* Network connection problem
* Printer configuration issues
* Print queue problems
* Printer driver problems

## How to Fix Brother Printer Offline: Initial Checks

The above problems can make your Brother printer hard to print and slow you down. It's time to uncover initial checks!

**1. Error Messages and Blinking Lights**

Look for error messages or blinking lights to pinpoint specific problems like low ink, toner, or paper jams causing the printer to go offline. Resolving these errors can help fix the issue.

**2. Unplugging and Restarting**

Unplug and restart the printer and computer. This simple action can refresh the printer configuration and establish a proper connection.

**3. Checking Cable Connections** 

Examine cable connections. If restarting doesn't work, a damaged or improperly connected cable could be the issue. Check for loose or disconnected cables, damage, or faults. Test different ports or use a new cable to identify the problem. If the printer works with a different cable, replace the original one.

**4. Network Connection Issues** 

Diagnose network connection problems. Signs include difficulty connecting wirelessly, slow or interrupted printing, and network-related error messages. Follow these steps to resolve network issues.

* ***Check Wi-Fi Signal:*** Weak or fluctuating Wi-Fi signals and internet interruptions suggest an unstable network. If you encounter these issues, move your computer closer to the Wi-Fi router.
* ***Verify Printer's Network:*** In the network settings menu, confirm that the printer is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network, matching your computer's connection. If not, select the appropriate network and enter the password if needed.
* ***Restart Devices:*** If proximity adjustments don't work, power off both the printer and router. Unplug their power cables and wait 30 seconds before plugging them back in and powering them on. This can refresh the network connection.
