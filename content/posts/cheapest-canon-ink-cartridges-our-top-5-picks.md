## Cheap Printer Ink Canon: Factors To Consider Before Buying

When choosing affordable Canon printer ink, there are more factors to consider than just the initial price. Before we look at the top 5 cheapest Canon ink cartridges, let's first discuss three key factors that will help you pick the right one for your needs.

### 1. Understanding Page Yield

Understanding the different ink cartridge options is essential for finding the cheapest Canon ink cartridges. Canon offers two main types: **standard-yield cartridges and high-yield cartridges.** Page yield measures how many pages a cartridge can print before it runs out of ink. Let’s discuss the difference between each:

* **Standard Ink Cartridges**

  These ink cartridges are the cheaper option upfront but may not be the best fit for heavy users. For example, a standard ink cartridge might be ideal if your household has a printer primarily used to print out school assignments.
* **High-Yield Ink Cartridges**

  Also known as XL or XXL cartridges (for extra higher yield ink cartridges), these high-yield cartridges contain more ink and are specifically designed for frequent and high-volume printing. Despite a slightly higher initial cost, they offer a better cost-per-page ratio, making them cost-effective in the long run—especially valuable for businesses with regular printing needs.

### 2. Calculating Cost Per Page

To determine if the ink cartridge is truly cheap based on your printing needs, you must learn how to calculate the ink cartridge’s cost per page. Knowing the cost per page helps you manage your printing expenses better. It shows you the real cost of each printed page, considering both the cartridge price and how many pages it can print. This knowledge helps you choose ink that fits your budget and printing habits.

**Here's what you need to consider:**

* **Cost**

  The cost of the ink cartridge is the upfront price you pay to purchase it. Depending on your printing needs, you might opt for the lower upfront cost if you don't print frequently, or you may prefer to invest in a cartridge with a slightly higher initial cost for long-term savings if you print often.
* **Page Yield**

  This tells you how many pages an ink cartridge can print before you need a new one. While cartridges with higher page yields cost a bit more upfront, they're a better deal for businesses overall because they print more pages before running out. If you don't print a lot, standard ink cartridges will be the best choice for you.

Now, let's figure out the cost per page using this formula:

**Cost per page = Ink cartridge price / Number of pages it can print (page yield)**

Let's use standard HP 60 black ink, for example, to see the cost per page difference between this standard yield and its higher yield counterpart HP 60XL black ink cartridge:

### 3. Choosing the Most Cost-Effective Ink for Your Needs

Think about how you use your printer and what aligns with your budget. As you ponder these aspects, keep these five essential factors in mind:

* **Printing Frequency**

  Reflect on how often you print—daily, weekly, or monthly. If your printing is frequent, high-yield cartridges could save you more money in the long run. If you print less often, standard ink might suit you better.
* **Print Volume**

  Monitor how much you print each time you use your printer. If you often print many pages at once, it's smart to go for high-yield cartridges. These cartridges have more ink and are better for large print tasks, offering efficiency and cost savings compared to cartridges with less ink.
* **Color vs. Monochrome Printing**

  If your printing involves a lot of black and white with occasional color, consider choosing tricolor cartridges instead of individual ones. This choice can lead to more cost-effective use.
* **Types of Documents**

  Know what you primarily print—documents, photos, or graphics. If your printing includes high-quality images, leaning towards high-yield cartridges could be a great way to save on costs.
* **Quality Requirements**

  Consider the level of print quality you need. If quality matters, a high-yield option might give you better value, even if it means a slightly higher cost.
