## Making Informed Choices: Going Beyond the Basics



When it comes to picking the right Canon printer ink that doesn't drain your wallet, there's more to consider than just the starting price. Before we discuss the top 5 cheapest Canon ink, check first the three factors that will help you choose the cheap ink cartridges suitable for your needs.



### 1. Understanding Your Cheapest Canon Ink Cartridge Options

When finding the cheapest Canon ink cartridges, understanding the various ink cartridge options available is crucial in making the best decision. The two main ink cartridges that Canon offers are standard and high-yield cartridges.



* **Standard Ink Cartridges:**

These ink cartridges tend to be the cheaper option upfront but may not be the best fit for heavy users. For example, a standard ink cartridge might be the ideal choice if your household has a printer primarily used to print out school assignments.



* **High-Yield Ink Cartridges**

Also known as XL or XXL cartridges, these higher-yield cartridges contain more ink and are specifically designed for frequent and high-volume printing.



Despite a slightly higher initial cost, they offer a better cost-per-page ratio, making them cost-effective in the long runâ€”especially valuable for businesses with regular printing needs.
