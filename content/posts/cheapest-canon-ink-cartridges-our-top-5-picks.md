Are you looking for the cheapest Canon ink cartridges to save money without compromising print quality? You're in luck! Today, we'll discuss five of the cheap ink for Canon printers.

**In this guide, we will discuss the following:**

1. Making Informed Choices: Going Beyond the Basics
2. Top 5 Cheapest Ink Cartridges for Your Needs
3. Exploring Third-Party Ink Cartridges for Maximum Savings



So, let's get started and explore the cost-saving opportunities of Canon ink!

## Making Informed Choices: Going Beyond the Basics

When it comes to picking the right Canon printer ink that doesn't drain your wallet, there's more to consider than just the starting price. Before we discuss the top 5 cheapest Canon ink, check first the three factors that will help you choose the cheap ink cartridges suitable for your needs.

### 1. Understanding Your Cheapest Canon Ink Cartridge Options

When finding the cheapest Canon ink cartridges, understanding the various ink cartridge options available is crucial in making the best decision. The two main ink cartridges that Canon offers are standard and high-yield cartridges.

* **Standard Ink Cartridges**

These ink cartridges tend to be the cheaper option upfront but may not be the best fit for heavy users. For example, a standard ink cartridge might be the ideal choice if your household has a printer primarily used to print out school assignments.

* **High-Yield Ink Cartridges**

Also known as XL or XXL cartridges, these higher-yield cartridges contain more ink and are specifically designed for frequent and high-volume printing.

Despite a slightly higher initial cost, they offer a better cost-per-page ratio, making them cost-effective in the long run—especially valuable for businesses with regular printing needs.

### 2. [Calculating Cost Per Page](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-calculate-printing-cost-per-page)

To find out if the ink cartridge is truly cheap based on your printing needs, you need to learn how [to calculate the ink cartridge's cost per page.](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-calculate-printing-cost-per-page) Understanding the cost per page is essential for efficient print expense management. It enables you to gauge the actual cost of each printed page, considering both the cartridge price and page yield. This knowledge empowers you to make cost-effective ink choices aligned with your budget and printing frequency.

**Here's what you need to consider:**

* **Cost:** The cost of the ink cartridge is the upfront price you pay to purchase it. Depending on your printing needs, you might opt for the lower upfront cost if you don't print frequently, or you may prefer to invest in a cartridge with a slightly higher initial cost for long-term savings if you print often.
* **Page Yield:** This tells you how many pages an ink cartridge can print before you need a new one. While cartridges with higher page yields cost a bit more upfront, they're a better deal for businesses overall because they print more pages before running out. If you don't print a lot, standard ink cartridges will be the best choice for you.

Now, let's figure out the cost per page using this formula:

**Cost per page = Ink cartridge price / Number of pages it can print (page yield)**

Let's use standard HP 60 black ink, for example, to see the cost per page difference between this standard yield and its higher yield counterpart HP 60XL black ink cartridge:

### 3. Choosing the Most Cost-Effective Ink for Your Needs

Think about how you use your printer and what aligns with your budget. As you ponder these aspects, keep these five essential factors in mind:

1. **Printing Frequency**

   Reflect on how often you print—daily, weekly, or monthly. If your printing is frequent, high-yield cartridges could save you more money in the long run. If you print less often, standard ink might suit you better.
2. **Print Volume**

   Monitor how much you print each time you use your printer. If you often print many pages at once, it's smart to go for high-yield cartridges. These cartridges have more ink and are better for large print tasks, offering efficiency and cost savings compared to cartridges with less ink.
3. **Color vs. Monochrome Printing**

   If your printing involves a lot of black and white with occasional color, consider choosing tricolor cartridges instead of individual ones. This choice can lead to more cost-effective use.
4. **Types of Documents**

   Know what you primarily print—documents, photos, or graphics. If your printing includes high-quality images, leaning towards high-yield cartridges could be a great way to save on costs.
5. **Quality Requirements**

   Consider the level of print quality you need. If quality matters, even if it means a slightly higher cost, a high-yield option might give you better value in the end.

## So, What are the Top 5 Cheap Ink for Canon Printer?

At this point, you might already know which type of cheap ink for Canon printers is the right fit for your printing needs. Now, let's move forward and talk about the five most affordable ink cartridges based on your printing needs.
