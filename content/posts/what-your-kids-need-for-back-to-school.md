[![Back-to-school products](/blog/images/bts2016.jpg "Back to School 2016")](/blog/images/bts2016.jpg)Back-to-school time is here! Summer is coming to an end, and your children are probably getting ready to head to school. Do you have all the essential gear they need for a successful school year? We've compiled a list of must-have items for a few age ranges.

* Drawing or construction paper
* Glue sticks
* Large eraser
* No. 2 pencils
* Ruler
* Stapler
* Storage box to hold pencils, crayons, etc.
* Tape

### Middle and High School

In addition to some of the items above, such as a ruler, tape, and stapler, older students will need a few more products.

* Ballpoint pens
* Calculator
* College-ruled loose-leaf notebook paper
* Combination locks, if your child's school doesn't have built-in locks on the lockers
* Highlighters
* Folders
* Index cards
* [Ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com)
