* Choosing the Best Printer that Scans: Key Factors
* Best Printer with Scanner For 2025: Our Top Picks!

  A. Laser Printers with Scanners

  B. Inkjet Printers with Scanners

## **Choosing the Best Printer that Scans: Key Factors**

A printer with a scanner is a must-have for homes, offices, and businesses, making it easy to print, scan, and store digital copies of documents. With so many options available, here’s what to consider when choosing the best printer scanner for home or office:

### **1. Scanning Features to Look For**

Not all printers can offer the same level of scanning quality and convenience. If you scan documents often, it's important to look for the right features to make the process easier and more efficient. Here’s a closer look at key scanning features to consider:

#### **A. Flatbed Scanner: Best for High-Quality and Delicate Scanning**

![Flatbed Scanner](/blog/images/ingoude.-presentation-70-.png "Example of a printer with a flatbed scanner")

*Example of a printer with a flatbed scanner ([Epson Expression Home XP-4200](https://epson.com/For-Home/Printers/Inkjet/Expression-Home-XP-4200-Wireless-Color-Inkjet-All-in-One-Printer-with-Scan-and-Copy/p/C11CK65201))*

A flatbed scanner is the most common type found in printers with scanners. It has a glass surface where you place documents, books, photos, or even small objects for scanning.

* Ideal for high-resolution scans, making it perfect for capturing fine details in photos and documents.
* Works well for fragile materials like old photographs, certificates, or delicate paperwork since you don’t have to feed them through a roller.
* Useful for scanning pages from books or magazines without damaging them.

#### **B. Automatic Document Feeder (ADF): Best for Scanning Multiple Pages Quickly**

{{< embedImage image="/blog/images/ingoude.-presentation-71-.png" alt="Automatic Document Feeder (ADF)" title="Automatic Document Feeder (ADF)" alignment="center" >}}

*Example of an ADF printer scanner ([HP Color Laserjet Pro MFP 3301fdw - Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/dp/B0CTW43KHQ?th=1))*

An ADF is a must-have feature if you frequently scan multiple pages at a time. Instead of placing each page on the scanner manually, an ADF allows you to load a stack of papers, and the printer will scan them one by one automatically.

* Saves time by scanning several pages in a row without needing manual input.
* Great for offices, students, or businesses that handle contracts, reports, or invoices regularly.
* Some advanced ADFs can handle different paper sizes, including receipts, legal documents, or business forms.

#### **C. Duplex Scanning: Best for Double-Sided Documents**

{{< embedImage image="/blog/images/ingoude.-presentation-72-.png" alt="Duplex Scanning" title="Duplex Scanning" alignment="center" >}}

*Example of a printer with a duplex scanning feature ([HP OfficeJet Pro 9135e - Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFM7VJNK?tag=track-ect5-usa-1031445-20&linkCode=osi&th=1))*

Duplex scanning means the printer can scan both sides of a document in one pass rather than requiring you to flip the page and scan it again.

* Saves time and effort, especially when dealing with double-sided contracts, ID cards, and business paperwork.
* Helps reduce paper clutter by making it easier to store digital copies of important documents.
* Ideal for businesses that process a lot of paperwork, like legal offices or accounting firms.

By choosing an office or home printer scanner that includes these features, you can speed up your workflow and get high-quality scans with less effort.

***QUICK TIPS: Which scanning feature should you choose?***

* If you scan photos or single pages, a flatbed scanner is enough.
* If you scan large documents often, choose a printer with an ADF.
* If you scan double-sided documents frequently, get a duplex scanner.

### **2. Connectivity Options for Scanning Convenience**

The right connection makes scanning effortless. Whether you need wireless flexibility, wired stability, or mobile convenience, choosing the best option ensures a seamless experience.

* **Wireless (Wi-Fi & Bluetooth)** – Scan from anywhere to your laptop, phone, or cloud with a wireless printer scanner. Wi-Fi is great for multiple users, while Bluetooth is ideal for quick, direct connections.
* **USB & Ethernet** – Fast and stable. USB connects directly to a computer, while Ethernet allows multiple users to scan to shared folders.
* **Cloud & Mobile Apps** – Scan on the go with mobile apps. Upload to Google Drive, convert to PDFs, or use OCR for editable text.

### **3. Scanner Resolution: Does It Matter?**

Yes! Scanner resolution is one of the most important factors when choosing a printer with scanner, especially if you need clear, high-quality scans. The resolution is measured in dots per inch (DPI), determining how much detail the scanner captures. The higher the DPI, the sharper and more detailed the scan.

* **300 DPI** – Ideal for basic document scanning, such as invoices, contracts, and text-based files.
* **600 DPI** – A good choice for scanning images, business documents with graphics, and official paperwork that requires extra clarity.
* **1200+ DPI** – Best for high-quality photo scanning, artwork, or documents with very fine details.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **1. What is the difference between a laser and an inkjet printer with a scanner?**

Laser printers use toner and are ideal for high-speed, cost-effective printing, while inkjet printers use liquid ink and excel at producing vibrant colors. If you need sharp text and heavy-duty printing, go for a laser model. Inkjet printers are better for color documents and occasional use.

### **2. Does a higher DPI scanner mean better quality?**

Yes, a higher DPI (dots per inch) means more detail in scanned images. 300 DPI is good for documents, 600 DPI works for graphics and photos, and 1200+ DPI is best for high-quality images and artwork. However, higher DPI scans take up more storage space.

### **3. Can I print and scan from my phone?**

Yes! Most modern printers with scanners support mobile printing and scanning through apps like Epson Smart Panel, HP Smart, or Brother iPrint&Scan. You can scan documents, save them to the cloud, or send them via email directly from your smartphone.
