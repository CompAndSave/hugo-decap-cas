* Ideal for high-resolution scans, making it perfect for capturing fine details in photos and documents.
* Works well for fragile materials like old photographs, certificates, or delicate paperwork since you don’t have to feed them through a roller.
* Useful for scanning pages from books or magazines without damaging them.
