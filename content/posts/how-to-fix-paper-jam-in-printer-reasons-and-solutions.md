## Paper Jams In Printer: What Causes This Problem?

A paper jam is when paper gets stuck inside the printer and can’t move through as it should. This can stop the printer from working until the paper is cleared. To better understand how a paper jam in printer happens, we listed here some common reasons:

* If the paper is not placed correctly, it can cause a jam.
* Putting too many sheets in the tray can make it hard for the printer to pull them in.
* Old, torn, or wrinkled paper can quickly get stuck.
* Dust or tiny pieces of leftover paper can block the paper path.
* Over time, the rollers that move the paper can wear out and cause jams.

## How To Unjam A Printer: Step-By-Step Guide

Now that we know some of the reasons for paper jams in printers let’s discuss the steps of how to unjam a printer quickly. Here are the easy steps you can follow based on your printer model:

## How To Fix A Paper Jam In A Printer Error: No Stuck Paper Inside

Sometimes, the printer shows a paper jam error even when there's no paper stuck inside, which is what we call a “phantom paper jam” error. To help you with this, there are a few simple steps you can follow on how to fix a paper jam in a printer and get your printer working again. Here, we have a sample error in Epson Ecotank, but it might also apply to other printer models.

### For Epson ET-8550 Printer Users

**Step 1:** Look for a sign that shows a paper jam error even when there is no paper inside. Then, turn off the printer.

**Step 2:** Open the printer cover to look inside and check the gears.

**Step 3:** Look for a small gear that may be misaligned. This gear must align with another gear on the left side at the back of the printer. See the picture below.

**Step 4:** Ensure that the small gear is correctly aligned with the left-hand side of the larger gear. If it’s not aligned, it can cause the printer to think there’s a paper jam.

**Step 5:** If you see that the small gear has slipped off slightly, gently nudge it back into place so that it aligns correctly with the larger gear.

**Step 6:** After adjusting, close the printer cover and turn on the printer to see if the error message has cleared.

**Step 7:** Print a test page to ensure the paper jam error doesn't happen again.

If you've followed all the steps on how to fix printer paper jam but your printer still isn't working or has other issues, it's a good idea to get help from a certified technician to help you troubleshoot the problem.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Why is my printer saying paper jam but everything is clear?

Your printer might show a paper jam error even when no paper is stuck for several reasons. One common cause is misaligned gears inside the printer; if the gears that help move the paper are not lined up correctly, the printer can mistakenly think there is a jam. Also, worn-out rollers may not grab the paper well, which can cause similar errors. To fix this, check for misaligned gears and clean the printer to ensure everything works smoothly.

### 2. Can a paper jam cause damage to my printer?

In most cases, if your printer keeps jamming paper, it won't cause permanent damage if you address the issue quickly and correctly. However, if you try to remove the paper forcefully, it could damage the printer's parts. So, always make sure to follow the proper steps for clearing jams.

### 3. How often should I clean my printer to prevent paper jams?

To prevent paper jams, you should clean your printer regularly. It's a good idea to clean the printer, especially the paper path, whenever you change the paper stack or notice that the print quality is worsening. This helps remove dust and debris that can cause jams and keeps your printer running smoothly.
