## Paper Jams In Printer: What Causes This Problem?

A paper jam is when paper gets stuck inside the printer and can’t move through as it should. This can stop the printer from working until the paper is cleared. To better understand how a paper jam in printer happens, we listed here some common reasons:

* If the paper is not placed correctly, it can cause a jam.
* Putting too many sheets in the tray can make it hard for the printer to pull them in.
* Old, torn, or wrinkled paper can quickly get stuck.
* Dust or tiny pieces of leftover paper can block the paper path.
* Over time, the rollers that move the paper can wear out and cause jams.
