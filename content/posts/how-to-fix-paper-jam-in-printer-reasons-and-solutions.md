## What is a Paper Jam?

Imagine you are using your printer, and suddenly, the sheets of paper inside it get stuck. This is what we call a "paper jam". It's like when you're trying to pour cereal, but the box is blocked, and you can't get any out until you remove the blockage. So, with a paper jam, your printer stops working until you remove the stuck paper in printer. After that, it goes back to printing normally.



## What Causes Paper Jam and How to Avoid it?

Before we learn how to fix paper jam in printer, let us understand why it happens. Knowing why paper jams happen is essential because it helps you prevent them.

### 1. Paper Misalignment

One common reason your printer keeps jamming is because the paper isn't put in the right way. When you don't load the paper correctly, it can become crooked and lead to paper jams in the printer.

**Tips to prevent paper jams:**

* **Check Paper Type and Size**: Make sure the paper you're using is suitable for your printer, and if necessary, change the settings on your computer and printer.
* **Inspect Paper Guides**: Make sure you align the paper guides in the tray with the paper stack's edges. They should grip the paper securely but not too tightly.



### 2. Dust and Debris

As time passes, you might notice dust and debris piling up inside your printer, getting in the way of your paper's path and causing those annoying paper jams. You must clean your printer regularly to prevent these issues and smooth your printing experience.

**Tips to prevent paper jams:**

* **Clean the Rollers**: Clean the rollers and interior surfaces with a damp, lint-free cloth to remove dust and debris.
* **Regular Maintenance**: Create a regular cleaning schedule for your printer to avoid future buildup. Consult your printer's manual for specific cleaning instructions and how often you should clean it.



### 3. Worn Rollers

Over time, your printer's rollers wear out from regular use. These rollers guide the paper through the printer, ensuring smooth, jam-free printing. As they wear out, the rollers lose their grip on the paper, making paper jams more likely and disrupting your printing.

**Tips to prevent paper jams:**

* **Check the Manual**: Look in your printer's manual. It might have instructions on how to clean or replace the worn rollers.
* **Seek Professional Assistance**: If you need help with what to do or if the rollers need replacing, it's a good idea to get help from a professional technician. They can assess the situation and handle your needed maintenance or repairs.



### 4. Overloaded Tray

When you put too many sheets in your paper tray, it presses down on the paper too hard, and this can cause stuck paper in printer.

**Tips to prevent paper jams:**

* **Avoid Overloading**: Put only a few sheets in your paper tray. Follow your printer's manual guidelines for the recommended number of sheets to load.
* **Regular Checks**: From time to time, look at your paper tray. Ensure it's not too full, and check if the paper is aligned correctly. Doing this simple check can prevent paper jams.
