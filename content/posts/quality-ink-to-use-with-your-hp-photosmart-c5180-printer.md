The Quality of the ink used within your printer has a huge part to play, in just how the final printed image will appear on the paper. If you use low quality inks, then you could be aware of the poor quality images that you receive as a result. I can understand however why people may wish to use low quality inks, as I believe this is due to the price in which you pay for a genuine manufacture ink cartridge, in today's market. 

We are in a stage of the economy where not many people have money to spend on genuine ink cartridges, and many of us will prefer to refill the ink cartridges that we have used. This is not always the best option and can lead to many different problems, if they are used on a daily basis. There are however other alternative such as the compatible ink cartridge. 

The compatible ink cartridge is made to meet all guideline that have been placed on the manufactures own ink cartridges, therefore you will see no difference in the quality of the work produced by the printer. In many cases some people find that the quality of the work produced by the compatible ink cartridge is actually better than the OEM type. 

The Image you print from your printer is only going to be as good as the ink you have given your printer to use. Even if you own the very bet printer for printing your images, the results will still be poor if you are using low quality ink cartridges.
