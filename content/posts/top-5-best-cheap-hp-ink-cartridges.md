Have you tried buying a cheap HP printer only to realize that the ink cartridges cost more than the printer itself? Many people fall into this trap, thinking they’re saving money with a low-cost printer, only to spend a lot on replacement cartridges later. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid this problem and save on ink costs. If you’re trying to find cheap HP ink cartridges for your printer, you’re in the right place!

This guide will show you five of the [cheapest printer ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/top-5-best-cheap-printer-ink-cartridges) for your HP printer to help you save on printing costs. We’ll also share tips on buying cheap HP cartridges so you can find the best deals. So, read on and explore our top 5 picks today!

**Here are some things we will cover in this guide:**

1. Cheap HP Cartridges: How To Find The Best Deals?

2. Cheap HP Ink Cartridges: Our Top 5 Picks!

* Top 5: Cheap HP 920XL Ink Cartridges
* Top 4: Cheap HP 952XL Ink Cartridges
* Top 3: Cheap HP 564XL Ink Cartridges
* Top 2: Cheap HP 940XL Ink Cartridges
* Top 1: Cheap HP 934XL/HP935XL Ink Cartridges

## Cheap HP Cartridges: How To Find The Best Deals?

To save money on cheap ink cartridges for HP printers, you should first know how much it costs to print each page. You can do this by dividing the number of pages the cartridge can print or the page yield by the price of the cartridge. The formula is:

**Cartridge price/Page yield = Cost per page**

To understand it better, let’s calculate the cost per page for an OEM HP 63 ink cartridge, which is one of the top-selling HP printer inks.

The **OEM High Yield HP 63XL Black** Ink Cartridge costs $50.99 and has a page yield of 480 pages.

* $50.99/480 = **10.62 cents** cost per page

The **OEM High Yield HP 63XL Tri-color** Ink Cartridge costs $54.99 and has a page yield of 300 pages.

* $54.99/300 = **18.33 cents** cost per page

Now, let’s calculate the cost for CompAndSave's replacement high-yield HP 63XL ink cartridges and compare the savings when using more affordable HP-compatible ink.

We'll start with the **Remanufactured High Yield HP 63XL Black** Ink Cartridge, which costs $16.95 and has a page yield of 480 pages.

* $16.95/480 = **3.52 cents** cost per page

The **Remanufactured High Yield HP 63XL Tri-color** Ink Cartridge costs $16.95 and has a page yield of 330 pages.

* $16.95/330 = **5.14 cents** cost per page

As we can see from our [printing cost per page calculator](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/printing-cost-per-page-calculator-calculate-printing-easily.html), it's clear that remanufactured HP ink cartridges are a better option for saving money on ink costs!

### 2. How can I save money on HP ink?

To save money on HP ink, start by buying in bulk or opting for high-yield cartridges, which provide more ink at a lower cost per page.
