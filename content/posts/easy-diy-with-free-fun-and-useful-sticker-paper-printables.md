Even with all of the technology used by children now, seeing some encouragement on their papers goes a long way. Simply print our downloadable school stickers (preferably using [CompAndSave sticker paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/sticker-paper)) and then cut out the sticker shape. Voilà! Ready to reward little Jack or Emily for a job well done.

Keeping track of your water intake has never looked this good. You won't miss that daily reminder to drink up when you use our water count stickers. All you have to do is stick the reminders at various points on your water bottle, starting with "Filled" and ending with "Refill." Before you know it, you'll have downed that 32-ounce water bottle. Only one more bottle to go to reach the [recommended 64 ounces](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-water-should-you-drink-per-day)!
