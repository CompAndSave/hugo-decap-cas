In Part II of our comfort food [series](https://blog.compandsave.com/2016/12/comfort-food-for-mind-body-and-soul.html), vegetables take center stage. Just because we're focusing on vegetables this week doesn't mean these meals are boring. With the right seasonings and cooking techniques, vegetables can be just as flavorful—sometimes more so—than meat. Get ready to cook some comfort food for the mind, body, and soul!   

## Vegetable-Based Dishes

### Soups

### Variation of "Mushroom Soup with Winter Vegetables"

A meal can't get any more flavorful than this hearty winter soup from [Country Living](https://www.countryliving.com/food-drinks/recipes/a1721/mushroom-soup-winter-vegetables-3843/). If you're pressed for time, skip making your own vegetable stock and use good-quality store bought instead. You can also use pre-cut butternut squash too although it's usually more expensive than buying the whole squash. 

**Ingredients**\
2 heads garlic\
6 tablespoons unsalted butter\
2 large onions\
1 1/2 pounds assorted wild mushrooms\
8 carrots\
2 ribs celery\
8 sprig fresh parsley\
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\
1 bay leaf\
1 butternut squash, cut into chunks\
1 cup light red wine\
2 teaspoons salt\
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper\
2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 

**Directions**\
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Cut about 1 inch off the top of both heads of garlic, dot each with 1 tablespoon butter, wrap in foil, and roast at 400 until soft (about 45 minutes). Let cool and squeeze to release the roasted meat. Discard the skins and set meat aside. 

To make the vegetable stock, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large saucepan. Add half the onions and cook over low heat until caramelized about 25 minutes. Add the mushroom stems, half the carrots, and the celery and cook until soft about 10 minutes. Add 8 cups water, parsley sprigs, and bay leaf; increase heat to high; and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes. Strain and discard the solids. Add enough water to bring stock to 6 cups. Set aside. (Note: You can substitute this homemade stock with store-bought vegetable stock.) 

To make the soup, melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook the mushrooms in thirds, adding an additional 1 tablespoon butter with each batch, until golden about 3 minutes per batch. Add the remaining onion and cook until softened about 3 minutes. Add the squash and remaining carrots and cook for 2 minutes. Add the red wine, salt, pepper, roasted garlic, and reserved vegetable stock; stir to combine; and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until vegetables are tender about 25 minutes. Stir in chopped parsley and lemon juice and serve immediately. 

### "15-Minute Creamy Tomato Soup (Vegan) Recipe"

No time? No problem! You can still whip up a nutritious and delicious homemade soup in 15 minutes with this recipe from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/02/15-minute-creamy-tomato-soup-vegan-recipe.html). 

**Ingredients**\
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided\
2 cloves garlic, grated\
1 small onion, finely sliced (about 1 cup)\
1 teaspoon dried oregano\
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\
2 slices bread, crusts removed, torn into 1/2-inch pieces\
2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes packed in juice\
Kosher salt and ground black pepper\
Minced chives, basil, or parsley as garnish 

**Directions**\
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic, onions, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring frequently until onions are softened but not browned, about 4 minutes. Add bread and tomatoes. Roughly mash tomatoes with a whisk or potato masher. Add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over high heat and then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes. 

Transfer half of soup to a blender or use an immersion blender. Blend soup, starting at low speed and gradually increasing to high (be careful initially—the soup can shoot out the top of the blender so open the vent and hold a kitchen towel over the lid to prevent blowout). With blender running on high, gradually trickle in half of remaining olive oil. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat with remaining half of soup and olive oil. Ladle into individual serving bowls, top with minced herbs, and drizzle with more olive oil if desired. 

### Variation of "Roasted Sweet Potato Soup with Pistachio, Orange, and Mint Salsa"

This soup recipe is another one from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2014/12/how-to-make-sweet-potato-soup-pistachio-mint.html). If you prefer a plainer soup, skip the salsa in the last step. 

**Ingredients**\
4 pounds sweet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch\
6 tablespoons vegetable, canola, or grapeseed oil, divided\
Kosher salt\
4 medium carrots, peeled and diced\
1 medium onion, chopped\
5 cloves garlic, crushed\
2 sprigs sage (optional)\
2 quarts homemade or store-bought low-sodium vegetable stock\
1/4 cup orange juice and 1 tablespoon freshly grated zest from 1 medium orange, divided\
3/4 cup shelled roasted pistachios, crushed\
2 scallions white and light green parts only, thinly sliced\
2 tablespoons very thinly sliced fresh mint leaves (from about 5 sprigs)\
Pinch cayenne pepper\
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil 

**Directions**\
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Toss sweet potatoes with 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil and salt. Spread sweet potato on 2 rimmed baking sheets and bake for 1 hour, rotating pans front to back and top to bottom halfway through cooking. Increase oven temperature to 375 and cook until sweet potatoes are tender and lightly browned around the edges, about 25 minutes. 

In a large pot, heat remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add carrot, onion, garlic, sage (if using), and a generous pinch of salt. Cook until vegetables are just tender. 

Add sweet potatoes and vegetable stock and bring to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes until vegetables are very tender. Discard sage, if using. Add orange juice. Blend soup until smooth using an immersion blender or standing blender. Season with salt. 

In a mixing bowl, stir together pistachios, orange zest, scallions, mint, and cayenne pepper. Fold in olive oil and season with salt. 

Serve soup, spooning pistachio salsa on top.

### Other Vegetable Dishes

### "Oven Risotto with Kale Pesto"

Want a meal that looks gourmet but doesn't require much work? Then check out this risotto recipe from [Bon Appétit](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/oven-risotto-with-kale-pesto). 

**Ingredients**\
1/2 cup walnuts, coarsely chopped, divided\
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided\
1 medium onion, finely chopped\
1 cup Arborio rice\
Kosher salt and ground black pepper\
1/2 cup dry white wine\
2 cups very hot water\
1 small garlic clove\
1 cup (packed) fresh parsley leaves\
3 tablespoons chopped fresh chives\
2 cups torn Tuscan ("dinosaur") kale leaves, divided\
1/4 cup cold water\
3/4 cup very hot water\
2 tablespoons unsalted butter\
3 ounces Parmesan, finely grated (about 2 cups)   

 **Directions**\
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing occasionally, for 8–10 minutes until golden brown. Let cool. 

Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large ovenproof saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring often, for 5–8 minutes until softened and translucent. Stir in rice; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes until some grains are translucent. 

Add wine, bring to a simmer, and cook until pan is almost dry, about 3 minutes. Add 2 cups of hot water; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover, and bake in oven until liquid is mostly absorbed but rice is still starchy in the center, which should be 15–18 minutes (it should be undercooked). 

Pulse garlic and half of toasted walnuts in a food processor until very finely ground. Add parsley, chives, half of kale, remaining 2 tablespoons of oil, and 1/4 cup cold water. Process until smooth and then season pesto with salt and pepper. 

In a saucepan over medium heat, add 3/4 cup of very hot water and cook rice, stirring constantly, until it is tender but still has some bite and sauce is creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in pesto, butter, most of Parmesan (1 1/2 cups), and remaining kale. Adjust consistency with water and salt and pepper, if needed. Top with remaining walnuts and cheese and serve.
