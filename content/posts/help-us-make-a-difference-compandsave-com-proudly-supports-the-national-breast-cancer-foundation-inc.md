We are more than half way through this year's [Breast Cancer Awareness Month](https://www.compandsave.com)! With your participation we've managed to collect a substantial amount of donations for the National Breast Cancer Foundation, in support of breast cancer awareness

As your favorite ink & toner provider, we welcome the chance to do more than what's expected, and the popularity of our social media networks gives us the perfect angle to show those affected by breast cancer that we support them 100%. Here are a few ways you can further help our cause:

## Facebook


[![nantional breast cancer poster](/blog/images/300x300-3.jpg)](/blog/images/300x300-3.jpg)CompAndSave.com will donate $1 to the National Breast Cancer Foundation for every new like we receive on Facebook this month. This is a chance to not only bring about awareness to breast cancer but it will also bring us 1 step closer to finding a cure. So go to [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/compandsave.ink) and simply click on the like button and $1 will be donated to NBCF.

### Twitter


CompAndSave.com will also donate $1 to NBCF for every re-tweet of #pinksurvives we receive on Twitter. Our goal this October is to not only join the fight against breast and help find a cure, but we also want to support and empower those who are currently fighting this battle. Just navigate to your Twitter page, leave us an uplifting message with the hash tag #pinksurvives and we will donate $1 to NBCF.

### Pinterest


[Our "Pin it Pink" board](https://www.pinterest.com/compandsave/pin-it-pink-national-breast-cancer-foundation/) is another simple and great way to get involved and show some support. Just go to our Pinterest page after joining our board and pin a pink picture, or you can simply re-pin any of those pictures to help us create awareness for breast cancer. The picture you pin can be anything uplifting and supportive to breast cancer awareness. Only rule is that it has to be pink. You can be as creative as you want with this one.

### YouTube


Go to CompAndSave.com's Youtube channel to view our celebrity video in support of Breast Cancer Awareness. We've partnered with famed film and television actress Kathy Bates to create a video that is meant to show everyone affected by breast cancer they're not alone. We are in this together and together we will win the fight against this disease. So please feel free to subscribe to our YouTube channel and share the video with friends and family to support our cause further.

1 in 8 women, at one point in their life, will be diagnosed with breast cancer. We want to make sure that our current and new customers are aware of this and are taking the precise measures to keep themselves breast cancer free while supporting those dealing with this illness.
