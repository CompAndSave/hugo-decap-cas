## What Is A Photo Paper?

A photographic paper, or simply a photo paper, is a special type of paper designed specifically for printing photos. It has a base layer, usually made of high-quality paper or plastic, which provides stability and durability. On top of this base layer is a coating that helps the ink or toner stick properly, ensuring that the colors and images are bright. Finally, the top layer determines the finish of the photo, which can be either glossy or matte. This combination ensures your photos look sharp, vibrant, and professional even when just printing at home.

For our glossy vs matte photo paper print guide, let's first discuss the advantages of using glossy photo paper.

### [Glossy Photo Paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy)

Glossy photo paper is perfect for capturing graphics with a high level of detail and making the images pop. The main difference is that glossy gives your photographs an extra boost of brightness and adds details to the image. 

It has a higher resolution than matte photo paper, meaning your photos will look sharper and more polished. Additionally, the glossy paper makes capturing any highlights or shadows in your photos easier.

**Types of Glossy Photo Paper**

There are two types of glossy print. Learn more about the differences below.

**1. High-Gloss**

High-gloss photo paper has a very high gloss level, giving it the most reflective and shiny finish. This high gloss makes images look polished and realistic, providing the best contrast and resolution. High-gloss paper is best for photos you want to display in frames or photo albums, as it enhances the vibrancy and detail of the images.

2. [Semi-Gloss (Luster) ](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/lustre)

Semi-gloss, or luster, photo paper has less reflection and shine, sitting between a matte and full-glossy finish. It offers a good balance, reducing glare while providing vibrant colors and sharp details. It is ideal for printing photos that will be handled frequently or displayed without glass, as it resists fingerprints and smudges better than high-gloss paper.

**Characteristics Of Glossy Photo Paper**

* **Vibrant Colors**

  One of the benefits of using glossy paper vs photo paper matte finish is that it produces vibrant colors in your photos. The higher level of reflection causes the colors to appear more intense and lifelike.
* **Great for Graphics**

  Its higher resolution makes glossy photo paper ideal for graphic-heavy images, capturing intricate details and vibrant hues.
* **Suitable for High-contrast Images**

  The glossy finish is perfect for photos with many highlights and shadows, enhancing the contrast and bringing out fine details.

To understand them better, here are the pros and cons of glossy photo paper finish:

**Glossy Paper Is Best For:**

If you love taking detailed photos that look amazing with a glossy finish, then glossy photo paper is the best choice for you! Its high-quality printing results in photos that distinctively show the dominant colors instead of dulling them like matte. And since it's shiny and smooth, glossy offers a luxurious look and feel. This makes glossy photo papers best for the following:

• Portraitures

• Saturated Images

• Dense photos with a lot of people appearing smaller

• Landscapes

• Close-up images (macro photography)

• Party/Wedding (unless black & white)

• Architecture

• Wildlife Photography

• Marketing printouts (flyers, brochures, cards, etc.)

**Where to Buy Glossy Photo Paper?**

Glossy papers can easily be found online or in retail stores, but you never know the quality of paper or coating used. You might end up with a great deal on a bundle of low-quality paper. So, if you don't want to take that risk, check out the massive range of sizes and bundles of [glossy paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy) here at CompAndSave. We offer high-quality photo paper you can use when printing photos at home.

### [Matte Photo Paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/matte)

Matte photo paper is great for creating images with a vintage look. Its matte finish makes it resistant to scratches and smudges. Plus, it produces images that look great when printed on standard photo printers.

Matte for photos generates a muted look. It also works great for images that need to be printed in black and white or with color details preserved. Additionally, matte photo paper is great for designs with a light or pastel color scheme and images with a great deal of text.

Another great benefit of matte is that it changes less under light, which gives images a more sleek appearance when printed. Plus, the matte finish provides a more professional appearance when printing photos.
