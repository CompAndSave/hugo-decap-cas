## What Is A Photo Paper?

A photographic paper, or simply a photo paper, is a special type of paper designed specifically for printing photos. It has a base layer, usually made of high-quality paper or plastic, which provides stability and durability. On top of this base layer is a coating that helps the ink or toner stick properly, ensuring that the colors and images are bright. Finally, the top layer determines the finish of the photo, which can be either glossy or matte. This combination ensures your photos look sharp, vibrant, and professional even when just printing at home.

## Glossy vs Matte Photo Paper: How Do They Differ?

[![Glossy vs Matte Photo Paper](/blog/images/glossy-vs-matte-photo-paper.png "Glossy vs Matte Photo Paper")](/blog/images/glossy-vs-matte-photo-paper.png)

Both paper types offer superb photo reproduction but have different qualities that affect your final outcomes. To help you understand them, we will summarize the difference between glossy and matte photos and explain which is better for which use.

For our glossy vs matte photo paper print guide, let's first discuss the advantages of using glossy photo paper.

### [Glossy Photo Paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy)

Glossy photo paper is perfect for capturing graphics with a high level of detail and making the images pop. The main difference is that glossy gives your photographs an extra boost of brightness and adds details to the image. 

It has a higher resolution than matte photo paper, meaning your photos will look sharper and more polished. Additionally, the glossy paper makes capturing any highlights or shadows in your photos easier.

**Types of Glossy Photo Paper**

There are two types of glossy print. Learn more about the differences below.

**1. High-Gloss**

High-gloss photo paper has a very high gloss level, giving it the most reflective and shiny finish. This high gloss makes images look polished and realistic, providing the best contrast and resolution. High-gloss paper is best for photos you want to display in frames or photo albums, as it enhances the vibrancy and detail of the images.

2. [Semi-Gloss (Luster) ](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/lustre)

Semi-gloss, or luster, photo paper has less reflection and shine, sitting between a matte and full-glossy finish. It offers a good balance, reducing glare while providing vibrant colors and sharp details. It is ideal for printing photos that will be handled frequently or displayed without glass, as it resists fingerprints and smudges better than high-gloss paper.

**Characteristics Of Glossy Photo Paper**

* **Vibrant Colors**

  One of the benefits of using glossy paper vs photo paper matte finish is that it produces vibrant colors in your photos. The higher level of reflection causes the colors to appear more intense and lifelike.
* **Great for Graphics**

  Its higher resolution makes glossy photo paper ideal for graphic-heavy images, capturing intricate details and vibrant hues.
* **Suitable for High-contrast Images**

  The glossy finish is perfect for photos with many highlights and shadows, enhancing the contrast and bringing out fine details.

To understand them better, here are the pros and cons of glossy photo paper finish:

**Glossy Paper Is Best For:**

If you love taking detailed photos that look amazing with a glossy finish, then glossy photo paper is the best choice for you! Its high-quality printing results in photos that distinctively show the dominant colors instead of dulling them like matte. And since it's shiny and smooth, glossy offers a luxurious look and feel. This makes glossy photo papers best for the following:

• Portraitures

• Saturated Images

• Dense photos with a lot of people appearing smaller

• Landscapes

• Close-up images (macro photography)

• Party/Wedding (unless black & white)

• Architecture

• Wildlife Photography

• Marketing printouts (flyers, brochures, cards, etc.)

**Where to Buy Glossy Photo Paper?**

Glossy papers can easily be found online or in retail stores, but you never know the quality of paper or coating used. You might end up with a great deal on a bundle of low-quality paper. So, if you don't want to take that risk, check out the massive range of sizes and bundles of [glossy paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy) here at CompAndSave. We offer high-quality photo paper you can use when printing photos at home.

### [Matte Photo Paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/matte)

Matte photo paper is great for creating images with a vintage look. Its matte finish makes it resistant to scratches and smudges. Plus, it produces images that look great when printed on standard photo printers.

Matte for photos generates a muted look. It also works great for images that need to be printed in black and white or with color details preserved. Additionally, matte photo paper is great for designs with a light or pastel color scheme and images with a great deal of text.

Another great benefit of matte is that it changes less under light, which gives images a more sleek appearance when printed. Plus, the matte finish provides a more professional appearance when printing photos.

**Characteristics Of Matte Photo Paper**

* **No Glare**

  Unlike glossy paper, matte paper doesn't produce a glare effect. This means you can put photos inside a frame and cover them with glass, and they won't have a high glare. Since the matte surface absorbs light, it minimizes the shine or reflection.
* **Minimal Shine**

  Matte printing paper does not shine much when printed, giving your photos a more professional appearance.
* **No Fingerprints**

  Since matte printing paper is fingerprint resistant, you can print without worrying about fingerprints ruining the photos.
* **Non-Sticky Surface**

  The non-stick surface on matte printer paper doesn't stick to the glass frame if left for long periods, making it ideal for prints displayed in public.
* **Resistant to Scratching**

  The matte finish on photo paper resists scratches and smudges, making it great for printing photos that must be kept pristine.
* **Superb Color Accuracy**

  Matte photo papers reproduce colors accurately because light doesn't interfere as much with glossy papers, giving your photos a more realistic look.

**Matte Photo Paper Is Best For:**

Matte photo paper is best for prints with limited colors and muted image requirements. It's good for printing many text-heavy items (like cards, menus, invitations, and so on) because it's more durable than glossy paper when it comes to scratches. Plus, due to its ability to absorb light, it makes it easier to read text.

This makes them best for the following:

• Illustrations

• Sketch images

• Black and white photos

• HDR landscape photos

• Textured patterns

• Dark toned images

• Artwork with muted colors

• Designs that emphasize depth

**Where to Buy Matte Photo Paper?**

Although matte papers can be found online and at physical stores, they can be quite costly, and the quality is not guaranteed. CompAndSave helps its customers with top-tier matte papers at affordable prices (almost equal to the price of less costly glossy papers).

## Glossy or Matte Photos: Which Is Better?

[![Glossy or Matte Photos: Which Is Better?](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-06-27-at-11.30.06 pm.png "Glossy or Matte Photos: Which Is Better?")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-06-27-at-11.30.06 pm.png)

To be honest, it's a tough call because different people have different preferences and uses. Ultimately, **you're the one to decide** between matte photo paper vs glossy paper. Matte photos are popular for a different look, as they can give your images a vintage feel. On the other hand, many people prefer glossy photos because they look more polished and professional. 

So whether you choose glossy or matte photos, the real question is, what are you printing? We think the best approach would be to use both glossy and matte, depending on your needs. For instance, when deciding between glossy vs matte photo print, check what you are printing first. 

If you need to print something image-heavy with many distinctions and a range of colors, like magazine covers, go for a glossy finish. However, for text-heavy pages, matte is far better. If you are creating planners or premium diaries, matte pages will work flawlessly for writing pages (inside pages) as the ink dries quickly and doesn't spread much, which is a problem with glossy papers. 

If you are on a tight budget but plan on printing photos often, a higher-quality glossy paper is a good idea. They are more affordable and make your photos look more vibrant and real than matte ones. However, if you don't care about those things, then it is okay to use whichever kind of photo paper suits your fancy! 

## Photo Paper: Where To Buy Cheap Ones?

Are there any other types of photo paper for inkjet printers? Yes! Photo paper comes in different varieties. If you’re looking for other types of printing paper, such as sticker paper, magnetic sheets, and the like, CompAndSave has it. Get different kinds of specialty paper in various sizes.  

## Parting Words

So, between glossy vs matte photo paper, which is the best one? It all depends on what you print and where you will display them. Both options have their unique benefits. Glossy photo paper is great for vibrant, high-contrast images, while matte photo paper is ideal for a more subtle, glare-free finish. So, whether you choose glossy or matte photos, ensure they are the right type based on your needs to get the best results.

**Key takeaways:** 

* Glossy photo paper is great for pictures that need to be very detailed and colorful, like portraits, close-ups, and marketing materials. It makes the images look bright and sharp. Matte photo paper, on the other hand, is better for photos with a vintage or muted look, such as illustrations, black-and-white photos, and items with a lot of text.
* Glossy paper is usually cheaper and makes photos look bright and vibrant. However, due to its reflectiveness, it can stick to glass frames and isn't ideal for large prints. Matte paper is more expensive but has a better texture, is more durable, and makes text easier to read.
* When choosing between glossy and matte photo paper, consider what you're printing and how you'll display it to decide which type is best for you.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What sizes does photo paper come in?

Photo paper comes in various sizes to fit different printing needs. Common sizes include 8.5" x 11", which is standard for documents and photos. Smaller sizes like 5" x 7" and 4" x 6" are popular for smaller photos or greeting cards. Larger formats like 11" x 17" are good for posters and large-format prints. The sizes can vary by brand and how you plan to use them, giving you options based on your needs.

### 2. Can I use photo paper with any printer? 

No, it's important to use photo paper that is compatible with your specific printer type—inkjet or laser. Inkjet photo paper is designed to absorb ink effectively, resulting in vibrant colors and detailed prints. On the other hand, laser photo paper is engineered to withstand the high heat of laser printers and allows the toner to fuse properly, ensuring crisp, smudge-free images. Using the correct type of photo paper ensures optimal print quality and prevents potential damage to your printer.

### 3. Which is better for printing photos, inkjet or laser printer?

Inkjet printers are usually better at printing photos. They use liquid ink that makes colors vibrant and detailed. Inkjet printers can also print on different types of photo paper, like glossy or matte, which gives you more options for how your photos look. 

Laser printers, on the other hand, use dry toner powder. They're great for printing text and graphics sharply and quickly, but they might not reproduce colors as accurately as inkjets, especially in complex photos.
