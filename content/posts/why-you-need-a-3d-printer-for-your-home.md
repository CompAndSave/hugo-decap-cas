[![MakerBot Replicator Desktop 3D Printer (5th Gen)](/blog/images/makerbot3dprinter.jpg "5th Generation Desktop 3D Printer from MakerBot")](/blog/images/makerbot3dprinter.jpg)In January 2009, the BfB RapMan 3D printer became the [first commercial 3D printer](https://3dprintingindustry.com/3d-printing-basics-free-beginners-guide) available for sale. Since then, the 3D printing industry has flourished, with 80,000 desktop 3D printers sold in 2013, 160,000 sold in 2014, and 275,000 in 2015\. 

A July 2016 report from CONTEXT, an IT market research company, forecasts the global 3D printing industry to grow to $18.4 billion in 2020\. This growth largely stems from individuals like you and me entering into desktop or personal 3D printing. [Chris Connery, VP for Global Analysis at CONTEXT](https://www.3ders.org/articles/20160718-global-3d-printing-market-up-2016-expected-to-reach-18-billion-by-2020.html), says, "… as generations before had to become familiar with PCs, this generation needs to learn 3D printing."

  
### 3D Personal Printing Is No Gimmick

While you may think [3D personal printing is a fad](https://blog.compandsave.com/2015/03/will-3d-printing-pen-become-household.html) now, there are already useful applications of 3D, such as exoskeleton hands for greater accessibility. And with 3D printers gradually making the production of items even more convenient and personalized, you would be unwise to underestimate the use of 3D printers in the future.

You can find a variety of 3D designs at [MakerBot's Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/), the world's largest open source 3D printing design community. Ross Maddox at [LayerTrove](https://blog.layertrove.com/3d-printing-ideas/) also pulled together some great designs. Even if you don't have technical expertise or previous experience with 3D printers, you can still create household objects, accessibility items, and much more.
