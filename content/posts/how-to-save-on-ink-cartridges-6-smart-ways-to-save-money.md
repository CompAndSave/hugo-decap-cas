Therefore, leaving your printer on can help you avoid having to undertake regular maintenance cycles, saving a lot of ink.

We saw a discernible drop in ink usage when printers were left running, even with more ink-hungry models. Concerned about the expense and effects on the environment of energy? When inactive, inkjets use very little electricity. Thus, the savings on ink greatly exceed any worries about extra energy use.

Hence, turning on your printer might be a surprisingly good tactic if you're wondering how to save on ink cartridges.

### 2. Purchase in Bulk

While purchasing more than one or two cartridges at a time is necessary, planning can result in significant savings on printer ink. Some cartridges are available in XL sizes, which allows you to buy more ink for less money than you would if you were to buy several smaller cartridges.

Furthermore, ink is frequently offered in bundles, allowing consumers looking to save money on printer ink cartridges to take advantage of discounts for larger purchases. Plan and take advantage of larger cartridge sizes and bundled offers. This action will help you find the answer to your query about [how to reduce printing costs](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-reduce-printing-costs) effectively.

### 3. Select Recent Printing Technology

Selecting printers with cutting-edge technology is critical to learning how to save on printer ink. Modern printer models are usually more energy-efficient, which helps cut down on overhead. Furthermore, a newer printer consumes toner and ink more efficiently, which results in extra savings and a healthier bottom line.

The durability of your printer cartridges can be extended by using advanced page options like duplexing, draft modes, and other ink-saving settings. This will decrease the number of cartridges required over the printer's lifetime and increase the time between refills.

### 4. Know Your Printer

To determine how to save on ink cartridges, it’s also essential to know how many pages a single cartridge in your printer can print. You can estimate the output by carefully reviewing the specifications of the cartridges made to work with your printer model, even if the results will rely on your printing needs. Certain printers automatically print at a higher resolution, using more ink.

### 5. Select XL or High Yield Cartridges

We must first grasp what "yield" implies to understand how to save on printer ink. In other words, "yield" simply means "page yield," or the quantity of pages a cartridge can print before needing to be changed. High-yield cartridges, as the name suggests, print more pages, hold more ink (or toner), and require fewer replacements over time.

The standard number of pages is printed using a standard yield cartridge. A "standard" print quantity is approximately 300 pages. Although standard yield cartridges are less expensive, you need to buy more of them over time since you print fewer pages with them, which increases the cost per page printed.

### 6. Keep Your Printer Nozzle Clean

Keeping an eye on your printer heads is maybe the simplest thing you can do to improve your printing practices. The ink is dispensed by the printer ink nozzles, which spray the ink onto the paper. Consequently, a build-up of dried ink may cause these nozzles to clog. Clean the nozzle heads every few weeks or more frequently if you're a heavy printer.

## 6 Smart Tips on How to Save on Printer Ink

Printer ink is surprisingly costly, more so than luxury drinks or even blood. The average family spends around $120 each year on it. In this part, we'll share tips on how to cut down your ink costs without losing print quality.

Let's look at some practical tips on how to save money on ink for printers:

### Tip # 1: Use All the Ink in the Cartridge

Does your printer light illuminate? Or do you receive a warning that your ink is running low? If so, it's essential to understand how to save money on ink cartridges by maximizing the use of ink cartridges. If there seems to be some ink left in the cartridge after checking the ink level, continue using it rather than replacing the cartridge right away.

Remember that the ink comes out in a spray. It doesn't take much to fill a page, so there should be a good amount of ink remaining in the cartridge. After using it all, shake the cartridge to remove any remaining ink blockages, particularly in humid areas. Doing this may pull hundreds of extra pages out of a cartridge.

### Tip # 2: Choose High-Quality Remanufactured Ink Cartridges

If you are still wondering how to save money on printer ink, buying premium remanufactured printer cartridges from a reliable third-party seller like [CompAndsave](https://www.compandsave.com/), is one of the finest solutions. Remanufactured toner cartridges can offer an affordable substitute for costly original equipment manufacturer printer cartridges, all while delivering the kind of reliable, high-quality performance required to maintain a profitable business.

Seek solutions that offer a performance guarantee and are verified to have particular page yields.

### Tip # 3: Avoid Compatible Cartridges and Cheap Copies

Cheap foreign-made clones and "compatible" cartridges cannot match or surpass the performance and yields provided by their OEM counterparts, but premium remanufactured cartridges can. Not only may these fake cartridges be very ineffective, but they can also damage your printer and expose your business to a lawsuit or penalties for intellectual property (IP) infringement.

In addition to having a high failure rate, clones and compatibles are frequently made with hazardous ingredients that are bad for the environment and your health.

### Tip # 4: Use Color Ink Only When Necessary

Still wondering how to save money on ink for printers? It's advised to utilize color printing only when necessary if you own a color printer. You only use your black cartridge when printing in black and white. Colors are combined to create black-in-color ink cartridges used for black printing.

Thus, printing in black and white rather than color extends the life of your ink. Have an expert set your computer's default print settings to black and white or greyscale printing. 

### Tip # 5: When Printing Webpages, Use This Tip

Web page printing can waste a lot of ink. Web pages with images, links, ads, and formatting add a lot of extraneous printing and clutter. PrintFriendly is a free web application that helps you conserve paper and ink when printing by turning webpages into printable PDFs and eliminating ads, navigation, and other extraneous content.

### Tip # 6: Remain Clear of "Toner Pirates"

"Toner Pirates" are businesses that contact phone companies, attempting to sell printer toner or ink cartridges over the phone. They often use high-pressure tactics and make low offers. They falsely claim to represent your supplier and offer lower prices.

## Conclusion

When it comes to lowering the cost of ink cartridges, information truly is power. Implementing these simple strategies can effectively reduce expenses while upholding effective printing procedures. Choosing high-yield or bulk cartridges, being aware of your printer's capabilities, and selecting well-remanufactured options are all sensible ways to cut costs and encourage sustainability in your printing process.
