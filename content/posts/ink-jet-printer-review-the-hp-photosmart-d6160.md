The HP PhotoSmart D6160 printer is an all in one printer, which can be found available to buy in several stores worldwide. The Printer has been around for a little while now, however we have found it quite difficult to find a printer of which is able to match the many strengths that this printer holds. As it is an all in one printer it can be used for a variety of workplace and home printing tasks, if you require a printer which can also be used as a scanner and a fax machine then this printer may be the printer that you have been looking for. 

This PhotoSmart D6160 does not have a Bluetooth option, which many other HP printers have now been released with, however it comes with many other facility's and printing options or settings which more than make up for this lack of technology. Upon a first glance of this printer, it may look a little basic and outdated; this could not be further than the truth when you learn just how much this printer can actually achieve.

 We see this printer to be for the more experienced printer user, this is because there is also no LCD screen integrated into the printer, therefore it is a little harder to instruct the printer in the settings you wish for it to work towards. In recent models of the PhotoSmart series, this LCD screen has been used to great effect, and has enabled the user to search through the many printing options, and also select an option with ease. 

Despite the lack of some of these modern technologies, the PhotoSmart D6160 is a dedicated image or picture printer. It is able to print at fantastic speeds, and it has been found to print up to 33 pages per minute using colour ink and also up to 34 pages per minute using black ink only. These are speeds that many other brands of printer find difficult to accomplish using the latest in printing technologies. It is also an ink jet printer, and for an inkjet printer the quality which is achieved is outstanding. 

This is because the PhotoSmart D6160 printer uses six colours if ink, rather than the standard four colour in which many other printers use. [PhotoSmart D6160 ink](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/photosmart/d6160-ink-cartridges) can be expensive if you look to use the genuine types of cartridge; we recommend that you use cheaper alternatives such as the compatible ink cartridge, which will serve you to the exact same standard as the more expensive genuine types.
