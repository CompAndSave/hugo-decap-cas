## Cost Comparison: EcoTank vs Instant Ink

Cost is often a primary concern when [selecting a printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-choose-a-printer-tips-on-selecting-the-best-one-for-you.html). Understanding the initial setup and long-term expenses associated with Epson EcoTank and HP Instant Ink can help you make a more informed decision. 

### Initial Setup Costs

The initial investment in a printer can vary significantly between the two systems.

* Epson EcoTank Printers: The Epson EcoTank printers typically have a higher upfront cost, averaging around $200 to $500, depending on the model. However, this cost includes several bottles of ink, which can last for thousands of pages. 
* HP Instant Ink Eligible Printers: On the other hand, HP Instant Ink printers are generally less expensive, with many models available for under $200. However, users must pay monthly subscription fees for ink, which can add up over time.

**Ideal choice:** Overall, while the Epson EcoTank may require a larger initial outlay, it often proves to be more economical in the long run.

### Long-term Ink Costs

Long-term costs are where the differences between EcoTank vs Instant Ink become even more pronounced.

* EcoTank Refill Costs vs. Instant Ink Subscription Fees: For Epson EcoTank, ink refill costs are relatively low. A single bottle can be purchased for about $10 to $20, providing several hundred pages of printing.

* Break Down of Cost per Page: On average, the cost per page with Epson EcoTank can be as low as 1 cent per page, thanks to the high yield of its refillable tanks. In contrast, the cost per page with HP Instant Ink varies by plan, averaging around 3 to 5 cents per page.
