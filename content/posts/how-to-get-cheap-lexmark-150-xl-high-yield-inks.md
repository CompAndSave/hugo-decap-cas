First lesson of Ink-onomics, before buying a name-brand printer at a surprisingly low price, think about the price of the ink cartridges. Most companies sell their printers at a price that's very affordable in order to attract more customers. A printer has little to no value with its complement, the even more expensive ink cartridge. Lexmark is one of the many printer manufacturers profiting from the sale of expensive cartridges rather than the actual printers. With a long line of printers like the Lexmark Pro715, the Lexmark Pro915, and the Lexmark S515 costing $70-$200, the high expense of actually using these printers is almost unavoidable since these printers require costly cartridges.

Depending on your job function or purpose for having a printer, you may require new cartridges every 2-3 months. Another element to consider is that each printer is compatible with a specified type of ink cartridge. The Lexmark Pro915 and its respected relatives the Lexmark S310, S315 and S415 are only functional when there used with the **Lexmark 150XL High Yield** or the regular [Lexmark 150](https://www.compandsave.com/lexmark/150xl-ink-cartridges/150xl-4-combo) ink cartridges. The cost of a combo pack of 4 (1 black, 1 cyan, 1, magenta, 1 yellow) high yield ink cartridges is $118.98 at retail price (Staples). If you could **save over $90** on your purchase without voiding your printers' warranty, why wouldn't you? Unless you're printing money to regain what you spent on ink (which is illegal), buying re-manufactured cartridges is a great way to save.
