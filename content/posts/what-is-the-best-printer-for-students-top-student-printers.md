## Student Printer: What Are Some Things To Consider?

As a student, you’ll need a printer that’s affordable, reliable, and a high-quality—one that will last for years. However, choosing good printers for students can be challenging. To help you with that, we listed here a few things to consider before buying a printer:

### 1. Size

Where will you keep your printer—in your room, dorm, or shared apartment? You’ll want a portable printer that’s easy to move but still sturdy, especially if you plan to share it with roommates. When picking a printer, size matters—make sure it’s compact enough to fit your space.

### 2. Connectivity Options

Consider how you want to connect to your printer. Do you prefer wireless printing from your laptop, tablet, or phone, or do you need a USB connection? You can also look for printers with multiple connectivity options like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile printing apps to make printing easier and more convenient.

### 3. Functionality

Think about what you need your printer to do. Do you only need it for printing, or would scanning and copying be helpful, too? Multifunction printers, or what we call all-in-one printers, can handle all these tasks. So, consider your schoolwork needs when choosing the right printer.

### 4. Easy-to-use

Look for a printer that’s simple to set up and operate. As a student, you don’t want to waste time figuring out complicated settings. A printer with a user-friendly interface and clear instructions will make printing your assignments hassle-free.

### 5. Printing Speed

Consider how fast the printer can print documents. If you often have a lot of printing or need to print things quickly before class, look for a printer with a good printing speed. Check for its pages per minute (PPM) rating. The higher the PPM, the faster the printer will be, making it easier to handle your workload efficiently.

### 6. Printing Costs

If you plan to use your printer for a long time, ensure it won’t deplete your allowance.  Some printers might be expensive upfront but use affordable ink, while others may seem cheap but have high cartridge costs. Always check the cost per page to see if your printer will be worth it.

You can also save money on printing by purchasing high-quality compatible cartridges that are budget-friendly. Be sure to find out what type of ink the printer uses, as choosing [cheap printer ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/top-5-best-cheap-printer-ink-cartridges) can help you save more in the long run.
