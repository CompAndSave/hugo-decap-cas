If you use your printer for regular image printing you will have acknowledged the fact, that the mages you print use a significant amount of ink from your cartridge. This will mean that the ink cartridges you use in your printer will not last as long as you may have hoped. HP will always recommend that you use their own brand of ink cartridge, as this will be the best option for your printer. 

However this is not always the case and it also in no means a cost effective option. OEM ink cartridges are expensive to purchase and in the long term, these amounts will add up to a significant expense. This is an expense in which many of us cannot afford every month. There are other options that you can use to keep your printer running smooth and also to maintain ink in the system, which will cost only a fraction of the price you would pay for the OEM cartridge. 

The Compatible ink cartridge for example, is designed and tested to ensure it will deliver only the best quality when used in conjunction with your printer. They are specifically made to allow for all of the original manufactures specifications; therefore the quality you will receive from the final print will be exactly the same if not better. The Compatible ink cartridge has received some negative press over the years, however the positive reviews will far outweigh the negative ones, and you have to wonder, are the negative reviews just an attempt to halt the competition from top brand names.
