## Types of the Best Home Office Printers

There are two primary types of printers on the market: inkjet vs laser printers. Making the greatest choice for your household can be aided by being aware of the advantages and disadvantages of each type.

### 1. Laser Printers 

Although they print more quickly, laser printers are typically more expensive. If you're only occasionally using the printer, they print quickly, so you don't have to worry about the ink drying up, and even though they might cost a little more upfront, they usually have a lower operating cost per page.

### 2. Inkjet Printers 

Inkjet printers, while known for their higher ink costs, offer an economical choice for those seeking high-quality prints for documents and photos.

**Advance Printing Options** 

Before you shop, you should also consider how frequently you'll utilize extra capabilities like a scan function and duplex printing, allowing you to print on both sides of a page.
