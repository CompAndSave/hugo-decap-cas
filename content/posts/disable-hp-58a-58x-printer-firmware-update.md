Have you tried printing using your HP printer, but suddenly, the toner is not working? Well, it might be because of a firmware update. HP releases firmware updates to improve the performance and security of its printers, but sometimes, these automatic updates can prevent cheaper third-party toner cartridges from working. So, how can we disable the HP printer firmware update?

In this guide, we will show you the steps to disable auto HP firmware update for printers using 58A/58X toners so you won’t have any problem using them again. But if your printer has already been updated, you can try [downgrading the HP firmware](https://www.compandsave.com/hp-printer-firmware-downgrade) to a version that supports your toner. Also, if you want to avoid the hassle of downgrading, [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/) offers new toner cartridges with chips that work with the latest firmware!

**So, here are some things we will discuss in this guide:**

* How To Disable Automatic “Printer Update”

## HP Firmware Update: Which Printers Are Affected?

HP firmware is the software built into HP printers to help control how they work and perform their tasks. Firmware updates are released to fix problems, improve performance, or add new features. But sometimes, these updates can cause your printer not to recognize cheaper third-party toner cartridges. That’s why some users choose to disable automatic firmware updates to keep their devices running smoothly with the cartridges they prefer. 

This new HP LaserJet firmware update applies to the printers and toner cartridges listed below:

### Printers Using HP 58A/58X Toner Cartridges

* HP LaserJet Enterprise M406dn
* HP LaserJet Enterprise MFP M430f
* HP LaserJet Pro M404dn
* HP LaserJet Pro M404dw
* HP LaserJet Pro M404n
* HP LaserJet Pro MFP M428dw
* HP LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdn
* HP LaserJet Pro MFP M428fdw

### So, how would I know if my printer has been updated?

Well, if you have recently seen a message on your printer saying that the firmware has been updated, then it’s an indication that it was done automatically, especially if it's connected to WiFi. 

Also, we suggest checking your printer's firmware version by printing a **Printer Status Report** like the photo below to know if your HP LaserJet printer has been updated.

If your firmware version is 2149A, your printer is up-to-date. If not, you can turn off the "Printer Update" option. The section below will explain more details on how you can disable the auto-update of firmware for HP printers.

## HP Printer Firmware Update: Steps To Disable Automatic Updates

Now, to avoid future problems, especially if you want to keep using third-party ink cartridges, we recommend turning off your printer’s automatic HP firmware update. You can do this in two ways: first, by turning off the OEM Cartridge Policy on your printer (if available), and second, by disabling the automatic "Printer Update" feature.

### How To Disable "OEM Cartridge Policy"

HP has added an OEM Cartridge Policy feature that may prevent compatible cartridges from being used. To [disable HP cartridge protection](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-disable-hp-cartridge-protection), you can follow the steps below.

**Step 1:** Click "Setup" on the home page.

**Step 2:** Select "System Setup" from the Setup menu.

**Step 3:** Select "Supply Settings" under System Setup.

**Step 4:** Click "Cartridge Policy" in Supply Settings.
