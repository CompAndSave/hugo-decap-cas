As you may know, HP released a new firmware update, version 2149A, for LaserJet printers recently. New printer firmware versions are released to address bugs, add features, or update apps. However, if you use an aftermarket printer cartridge, this may not be the case as the latest update may cause your printer not to recognize third-party toner cartridges.



The good news is that CompAndSave's new batches of ink cartridges have chips that are compatible with the most recent firmware version so there is nothing to worry. Read on for the step-by-step guide on how to disable the "Printer Update" function.
