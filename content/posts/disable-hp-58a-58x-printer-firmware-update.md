Have you tried printing using your HP printer, but suddenly, the toner is not working? Well, it might be because of a firmware update. HP releases firmware updates to improve the performance and security of its printers, but sometimes, these automatic updates can prevent cheaper third-party toner cartridges from working. So, how can we disable the HP printer firmware update?

In this guide, we will show you the steps to disable auto HP firmware update for printers using 58A/58X toners so you won’t have any problem using them again. But if your printer has already been updated, you can try [downgrading the HP firmware](https://www.compandsave.com/hp-printer-firmware-downgrade) to a version that supports your toner. Also, if you want to avoid the hassle of downgrading, [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/) offers new toner cartridges with chips that work with the latest firmware!

**So, here are some things we will discuss in this guide:**
