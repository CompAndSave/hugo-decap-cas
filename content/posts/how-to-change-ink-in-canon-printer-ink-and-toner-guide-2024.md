## Canon Printer Ink: How To Check Ink Levels?

Before changing your ink cartridges, it's important to check which ones are running low or empty. There are several ways to check ink levels on a Canon printer. One method is to check the ink lamps, which are light indicators located on the operation panel of your printer. See the picture below:

When the light of the color ink and black ink lamps blink, it means that your ink is running low. If both ink lamps flash while the alarm light lights up, check the LED screen to identify the error.

This time, let us talk about how to check ink on a Canon printer through the application.

**STEP 1:** Open the **Canon IJ Status Monitor**. This application is available upon printer installation.

**STEP 2:** Click **Maintenance**. It will direct you to view the Printer Status.

Now that we have identified which ink needs changing, you might be wondering, "What ink do I need for my Canon printer?" You can easily find the correct printer ink by checking the name or label on your old cartridge. 

If there isnâ€™t any label, you can use the "[What ink does my printer use?](https://www.compandsave.com/what-ink-does-my-printer-use)" guide to help you determine the right ink for your Canon printer. Once you know which ink to use, you'll be ready for the next steps on how do you put ink in a Canon printer.
