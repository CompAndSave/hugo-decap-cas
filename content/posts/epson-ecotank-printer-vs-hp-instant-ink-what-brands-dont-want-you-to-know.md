[![Businessmen behind printer brands are thinking of more ways to make money by making people buy their expensive ink.](/blog/images/archive/2019/11/laptop-2561221_640-300x225.jpg "Boss office man in a suit and tie gesturing in front of his computer by StockSnap of Pixabay.")](/blog/images/archive/2019/11/laptop-2561221%5F640.jpg)

## Printer manufacturers make more money selling ink cartridges than selling printers. This is why printers are cheaper. By buying a printer, people would need to buy ink cartridges constantly, which are often more expensive. 

But if people avoid buying their expensive brand inks for cheaper compatible ones, they knew they had to adapt. 

So two known brands decided to solve this problem in their own ways. The question now is, which one is more beneficial to the consumer? 

## Epson Ecotank Printer

This printer is cartridge-free and comes with 2 years worth of ink. They were designed to have less waste by having refillable tanks instead of buying replaceable ink cartridges. 

However, it cannot be denied that this is also a way to make customers buy a large bulk of ink initially. Like mentioned before, printer manufacturers make more money selling ink than printers. 

The cost of an [Epson ET 2750 is $299.99](https://epson.com/For-Home/Printers/Inkjet/Expression-ET-2750-EcoTank-All-in-One-Supertank-Printer/p/C11CG22201). An Epson printer with almost the same features minus ET's ink supply, [Epson WorkForce WF-2750](https://epson.com/For-Work/Printers/Inkjet/Epson-WorkForce-WF-2750-All-in-One-Printer/p/C11CF76201), is $169.00 in [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B01DME4JBG/ref=dp%5Folp%5F0?ie=UTF8&condition=all). Its price is 56% lower than Epson ET 2750\. 

With EcoTank Printer, one is literally paying 55.86% more for ink. 

  
[![](/blog/images/archive/2019/11/1-300x222.png)](/blog/images/archive/2019/11/1.png)

However, the extra expense comes with its own benefits. The amount of ET ink as stated by Epson is comparably cheaper than 30 [Epson 220](https://epson.com/For-Home/Ink/Epson-220-Ink/i/T220220-S) cartridge ink sets (compatible with Epson WF-2750) which is worth $1,141.5\. 

However, once two years have passed, there are pressing questions that need to be answered. 

[Inkjet printers last about three years](https://cincinnatiprinterrepair.com/printers-lifespan). Is ET a good investment, with its high price of two years ink plus printer, if it would only last for three years?

How much does one have to spend on Epson ink?

How does Epson ET ink cost compare with others in the long run?

## HP Instant Ink

HP encourages people to buy their ink through monthly subscription. Only specific set of HP printers can have these subscription plans. 

Your printer is connected to your Wi-Fi and HP monitors its ink levels. Once its ink levels are low, they would deliver ink cartridges for you to replace with. Delivery can take up to 10 days.

This HP Ink Program charges by how much pages are printed. This means that a colored printed page would cost the same as a black-and-white printed page.

As an example, let's look at one if its subscription plan which is the "Moderate Printing Plan" which has an extent of 100 pages for $4.99 a month. If the subscriber has used up all 100 pages, they would be charged a dollar for every 15 pages. This may seem small but it may add up in the long term. Especially if they prefer not to upgrade their subscription to 300 pages for $9.99 a month. 

If the subscriber didn't print anything for a month, the Moderate Printing plan has a rollover of 200 unused pages. This means, the hp ink program will allow you to use 2 months worth of unused printing only. 

Before we compare the math between the two, there are also some concerns about Instant Ink that some people may not agree with.

With Instant Ink subscription plan, [you're permitting HP to monitor your printer activity](https://instantink.hpconnected.com/us/en/terms). This includes page count, type of documents that are printed, the device you use to print a particular document, ink levels and whether the cartridge you use is new or used. Under this terms of service, HP is allowed to share your [name, address, email address, printer model and serial number](https://instantink.hpconnected.com/us/en/terms) with the retailer whom you purchased the subscription from. 

Some people may feel this is an invasion of privacy while some would tolerate it. 

Your printer will also need to be online at all times for its activity to be properly monitored by HP. According to their terms of service of this date, if your printer isn't online, your Instant Ink-activated Cartridges will be "[disabled and you will not be able to use them to print; however, you will continue to be charged for the Instant Ink Service](https://instantink.hpconnected.com/us/en/terms)."

Furthermore according to their TOS, [if you don't pay in time, HP will temporarily cancel your plan](https://instantink.hpconnected.com/us/en/terms) and your Instant Ink-activated Cartridges. This can cause inconveniences for your business. 

## Doing the Math: Epson Ecotank Printer vs HP Instant Ink
