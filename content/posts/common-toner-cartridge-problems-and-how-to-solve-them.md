## What is a Toner Cartridge?

A toner cartridge is an important part of laser printers and photocopiers. It holds a special powder called toner, which is needed for printing. When you print something, the printer uses electricity and heat to put the toner on paper, making words and pictures. Toner cartridges can be changed when they run out, and they help make sure your prints look good and last a long time. They come in different types and sizes, depending on the kind of printer you have. But, like every other part of a printer machine, toner cartridges also get into technical hiccups and stop working properly as they should. How do you make it work again? We'll figure it out!
