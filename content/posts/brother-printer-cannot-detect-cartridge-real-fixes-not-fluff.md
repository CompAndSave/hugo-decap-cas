## **When All Else Fails: What to Do Next**

If your Brother printer cannot detect cartridge after trying every fix, it’s time to look beyond DIY steps. This issue often stems from damaged hardware, incompatible ink, or deep firmware blocks. When your ink cartridge is not recognised, and your printer won’t print, here’s what to do next.

### **Contact Brother Customer Support**

If the Brother printer not detecting ink message won’t clear, reach out to Brother’s official support. They can:

* Walk you through advanced steps
* Identify hardware issues
* Confirm if your model has known common printer problems

They may also check warranty status or offer free repair/replacement options.

### **Exchange Faulty or Incompatible Cartridges**

If support confirms that a Brother printer cartridge detection issue is cartridge-related, return or exchange it. Especially if:

* It’s a low-quality third-party cartridge
* It was recently refilled
* You’ve used it with another model

Using genuine or high quality replacements often resolves the Brother printer not recognising ink cartridge problem.

### **Use Brother's Diagnostic Tools**

If your Brother printer cannot detect ink cartridge, Brother offers built-in tools to run diagnostics. These tools help:

## **Pro Tips to Prevent Future Cartridge Detection Issues**

A recurring “ink cartridge not recognized” error can disrupt work, waste time, and become costly. Many common printer problems stem from simple mistakes users can easily avoid. If your Brother printer cannot detect cartridge often or your printer won’t print, these proactive tips can save you from frustration.

### **Use OEM or High-Quality Compatible Cartridges**

Always use original Brother cartridges or trusted third-party brands. Cheap knockoffs often trigger the Brother printer not detecting ink due to chip errors or poor build quality. OEM cartridges reduce the risk of detection failure and extend printhead life.

### **Avoid Auto Firmware Updates (If Using 3rd-Party Ink)**

Brother firmware updates may block third-party cartridges. If you rely on compatibles:

* Disable auto-updates
* Manually install only essential patches

This prevents the Brother printer from detecting ink cartridge errors caused by locked firmware.

### **Regularly Clean Cartridge Contacts and Printer Internals**

Dust or dried ink on contacts can confuse sensors. Include contact cleaning in your regular [printer maintenance tips](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/printer-maintenance-tips-to-extend-lifespan-guide-2025.html) routine. Use lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcohol. Clean:

* Cartridge chip area
* Contact points inside the printer

Clean hardware = fewer Brother printer not recognising ink cartridge alerts.

### **Replace Cartridges Before They Are Empty**

Avoid running cartridges completely dry. Empty cartridges often go undetected or cause chip failures. Replacing early ensures smoother ink recognition and reduces the chance your Brother printer will not detect ink mid-task.

## **Conclusion**

Dealing with the Brother printer cannot detect cartridge error can be frustrating, but the good news is, it’s usually fixable. Whether it's due to dirty contacts, a firmware glitch, or using a non-genuine cartridge, there are practical steps you can take. If your Brother printer not detecting ink, try cleaning the contact points, reinserting the cartridge, or performing a quick reset.
