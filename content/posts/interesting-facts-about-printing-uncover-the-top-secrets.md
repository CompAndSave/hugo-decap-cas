Let’s discover the mind-blowing printing industry facts that shape our world.

Printing has deeply influenced society and culture. It made knowledge accessible to more people, leading to higher literacy rates and the spread of ideas. This helped drive the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Printing newspapers and pamphlets was crucial for social movements and political revolutions. Even today, printed materials hold cultural and sentimental value.

These interesting facts about printing technology highlight its ongoing importance and transformative impact on our world.

## Key Facts About the Printing Industry: Revolution to Revelation

Printers have evolved significantly since their inception. Initially, printers were mechanical and used movable type. Now, we have digital printers that provide high-quality prints with a simple button click. This progress has made printing quicker, more efficient, and more accessible.

### Facts About Laser Printers Vs Inkjet Printer Facts

There are two main types of printers: inkjet and laser. Inkjet printers excel in producing bright colors, which are perfect for photo printing. Laser printers, however, are faster and more economical for printing large volumes of text. Each type offers unique advantages based on your printing needs.

**What Should You Choose?**

 ➤ Laser printers excel in speed, while inkjets win in color vibrancy. So, choose lasers for fast text and inkjets for vivid images.

### FACT 3: Printing ink's high cost is due to its complex production!

A surprising fact about the printing industry is the high cost of printer ink. Ever wonder [why printer ink is so expensive](https://www.compandsave.com/why-printer-ink-is-so-expensive-guide)? Manufacturers sell printers at low prices but profit from selling costly ink cartridges. This industry practice is crucial to consider when selecting a printer.

Understanding the various printer types and their associated printing costs can help you make informed choices and potentially save on printing expenses.

## Behind the Scenes of OEM Business Models: 3 Amazing Facts

This segment will delve into the hidden world of Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) business models. We'll uncover OEMs' strategic approaches and tactics in the printing industry. From pricing strategies to product lifecycle management, get ready to explore the intricacies that define the business side of printing technology.

### FACT 4: Printers are often built to expire, pushing you to upgrade sooner!

**Forced Obsolescence:** A surprising fact about printers is their built-in obsolescence. Manufacturers create printers with a limited lifespan, pushing consumers to buy new models frequently. This strategy boosts sales but also adds to electronic waste, posing environmental concerns.

### FACT 5: Ink cartridges can drain wallets with their ongoing expense!

**The High Cost of Ink Cartridges:** The OEM business model relies heavily on the sale of expensive ink cartridges. While printers are sold at low prices, the ink cartridges come with a high cost, leading to a constant need for replacements. This ongoing expense can be burdensome for consumers. To save money on printer ink, consider looking into the best cheap ink cartridges from third-party vendors like CompAndSave.

### FACT 6: DRM in printers limits your freedom to choose affordable ink!

**Restricting Consumer Choice:** OEMs use Digital Rights Management (DRM) to control the market. Some printers have DRM technology that blocks the use of non-OEM cartridges. This limits consumer choice and forces them to purchase pricier, brand-name cartridges. This practice has faced criticism for being anti-competitive and limiting consumer rights.

Being aware of these aspects of the OEM business model can help consumers make smarter choices when buying printers and ink cartridges. Knowing these practices can also help you avoid the pitfalls of obsolescence and high printing costs.
