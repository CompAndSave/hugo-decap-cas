**For Windows:**

* **Step 1:** Open the **Run Dialog Box** from Windows search, type "**control**", and press the enter key on your keyboard.

**For Windows:**

* **Step 1:** Go to the Windows search bar and type "**control panel**", then select "**Control Panel**" from the results.
* **Step 2:** In the **Control Panel**, choose "**Hardware and Sound**" or "**Devices and Printers**".

* **Step 6:** Your printer will switch to online mode and should be ready for printing.

**For Mac:**

* Step 1: Click the **Apple** menu in the top-left corner.
* Step 2: Select "**System Preferences**" from the drop-down menu.
* Step 3: In System Preferences, click on "**Printers & Scanners**" or "**Print & Scan**".
* Step 4: Choose your printer from the list on the left.
* Step 5: Click the "**Options & Supplies**" or "**Open Print Queue**" button.
* Step 6: In the print queue window, click on the "**Printer**" menu at the top.
* Step 7: If the printer is in offline mode, look for an option to "**Resume**" or "**Unpause**" printing. Click it to disable offline mode.

### 4. Need to Clear Print Queue

Your printer can sometimes act like that car stuck in traffic. Clearing the path is often all it needs.

**For Windows:**

* **Step 1:** Begin by opening the **run box from Windows** **search**, type "**services.msc**", and press enter to access the service window.
* **Step 2:** Right-click the spooler to open the properties, then click '**stop**'.
* **Step 3:** Open Windows File Explorer and input this â€” **%windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS** in the address bar.
* **Step 4:** Delete all the files in the Printer folder.
* **Step 5:** Revisit the spooler properties, click '**start**', and hit '**OK**'.
* **Step 6:** Restart your computer, and voila! The print jobs should be straightforward, and your printer should function seamlessly.

**For Mac:**

* **Step 1:** Click on **Apple** menu, and then select **System Settings**.
* **Step 2:** From **System Settings** window, click on **Printers and Scanners**.
* **Step 3:** Select your preferred printer and click the "**Open Print Queue**" button.
* **Step 4:** Next, choose the print job you want to cancel and click the close button (**X**) next to it.

If you want to clear the printer queue completely, you have two options:

a. Press "**Command + A**" to select all print jobs, then press "**Command + delete**" to cancel them.

b. Click on "**Printer**" in the menu bar and select "**Cancel All Documents**".

### 5. Spooler Service Needs Restarting

Here's a simple way to fix it:

**For Windows:**

* **Step 1:** Hit the **Windows key + R**, type "**Services.msc**", and press Enter.
* **Step 2:** In the service window, find and select "**Print Spooler**". If it's sleeping (read: Stopped), right-click and hit "**Start**".
* **Step 3:** Give it a moment, then check if your Epson printer is working.

**For Mac:**

* **Step 1:** Click on **Apple** menu, and then go to **System Settings**.
* **Step 2:** In **System Settings**, select **Printers & Scanners** (scroll down if needed).
* **Step 3:** Right-click on any empty space within the printer list area and select "**Reset printing system**".
* **Step 4:** A confirmation pop-up will notify you that resetting the printing system will delete all printers. If you wish to continue, click the "**Reset**" button.

### 6. Enabled SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

SNMP is often not needed for regular home users and may cause issues with printer communication. Disabling it can resolve printer offline problems.

**For Windows:**

* **Step 1:** Search for "**printer**" in the Windows search bar and select "**Devices and Printers**".
* **Step 2:** In **Devices and Printers**, ensure the Printers section is expanded to see your printers.
* **Step 3:** Right-click on the problematic printer and choose "**Printer Properties**" (not "Properties").
* **Step 4:** In the Printer Properties window, click on the "**Ports**" tab at the top.
* **Step 5:** Find the default port (indicated by a checkmark) and click "**Configure Port**".
* **Step 6:** In the new window, uncheck "**SNMP Status Enabled**" if it's checked. Click **OK** to save the changes.
* **Step 7:** Restart your computer and printer.

**For Mac:**

* **Step 1:** Click the **Apple** menu and select "**System Preferences**".
* **Step 2:** In **System Preferences**, click on "**Printers & Scanners**" or "**Print & Scan**".
* **Step 3:** Choose your printer from the list on the left.
* **Step 4:** Click the "**Options & Supplies**" or "**Options & Supplies**" button.
* **Step 5:** In the Options tab, look for an SNMP-related option like "**Enable SNMP**" and disable it.
* **Step 6:** Close the **Printer Options** window.
* **Step 7:** Restart your Mac for the changes to apply.

### 7. Printer Driver Problem

An outdated or corrupted driver might be the problem. Hereâ€™s how you solve it:

**For Windows:**

* **Step 1:** Start by opening the '**Control Panel**'.
* **Step 2:** Navigate to '**Add or remove program**', right-click on the Epson printer driver, and click '**Uninstall**'.

* **Step 4:** Click '**Add a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer**'.
