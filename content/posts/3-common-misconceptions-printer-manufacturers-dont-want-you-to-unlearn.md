According to [Home Printing Statistics of 2021](https://www.cartridgepeople.com/info/blog/home-printing-statistics), more and more people are printing at home, especially with the recent pandemic. 

* 28% of respondents use home printing for work.
* 14% are now printing for their children's home schooling or for their own studies.
* More than one in five people have a bigger print volume today than before the pandemic.

However, a third of the respondents are not taking advantage of third party cartridges. One can [save money up to 106.72%](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360015988191/how-much-money-will-i-save-by-purchasing-a-compatible-or-remanufactured-cartridges-?utm%5Fcampaign=3-common-misconceptions-printer-manufacturers-dont-want-you-to-unlearn&utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fmedium=social) when using [compatible cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360027230971/what-is-the-difference-between-remanufactured-compatible-and-oem-cartridges-?utm%5Fcampaign=3-common-misconceptions-printer-manufacturers-dont-want-you-to-unlearn&utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fmedium=social). One can also [save up to 64.82%](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360015988191/how-much-money-will-i-save-by-purchasing-a-compatible-or-remanufactured-cartridges-?utm%5Fcampaign=3-common-misconceptions-printer-manufacturers-dont-want-you-to-unlearn&utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fmedium=social) when using [remanufactured cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360027230971/what-is-the-difference-between-remanufactured-compatible-and-oem-cartridges-?utm%5Fcampaign=3-common-misconceptions-printer-manufacturers-dont-want-you-to-unlearn&utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fmedium=social). This is especially beneficial for home printing.

What is holding them back?

## Misconception #1: Third Party Cartridges Damage the Printer

22% of the respondents believe that third party cartridges will damage their home printer. 

Like OEM (original equipment manufacturer) cartridges, compatible and remanufactured cartridges are only sold in shops after passing quality tests and standards. They are designed to work effectively with their assigned printer without crossing any patents. 

### Do Third Party Cartridges Clog Print Heads?

Some people will have reservations on using third party cartridges because it may clog the print head. The consistency of third-party ink can be different from original ink. But just like original ink, it can dry on the print head over time and can simply be resolved by initiating their home printer's [cleaning cycle](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360026946112/what-do-i-do-if-the-nozzle-on-my-printer-is-clogged-and-won-t-print-?utm%5Fcampaign=3-common-misconceptions-printer-manufacturers-dont-want-you-to-unlearn&utm%5Fsource=blog&utm%5Fmedium=social).

Do Third Party Cartridges Leak?

Others are hesitant because compatible cartridges and remanufactured cartridges might leak. A cartridge only leaks if it's incorrectly inserted into the printer. Just like OEM cartridges, please read the instructions before attempting cartridge installation in order for it to effectively and efficiently seal tight. 

## Misconception #2: Third Party Cartridges Void Printer Warranty

17% of the survey respondents believe using third party cartridges will void their home printer's warranty.

Using compatible cartridges or remanufactured cartridges will not void your printer warranty. When you buy third party cartridges, printer manufacturers make less money. So if you use other cartridges besides their own, they will claim to void your printer warranty. 

But the truth is, it is illegal to void your printer warranty for using third party cartridges as of Magnuson-Moss Warranty Improvement Act. 

In its United States Codes Annotated Title 15 Commerce and Trade, Chapter 50 Consumer Product Warranties, Sections 2302, it is stated:

"No warrantor of a consumer product may condition his written or implied warranty of such product on the consumer's using, in connection with such product, any article or service (other than article or service provided without charge under the terms of the warranty) which is identified by brand, trade or corporate name; except that the prohibition of this subsection be waived by the commission if:

1. The warrantor satisfies the Commission that the warranted product will function properly only if the article or service so identified is used in connection with the warranted product, and
2. the Commission finds that such a waiver is in the public interest.

## Misconception #3: Third Party Cartridges have Poor Quality Print

As long as third party cartridges are high quality, and not low-grade ones found commonly in most online stores, there is almost no major difference in the print quality between OEM cartridges and third party cartridges.

A disadvantage of third party cartridge ink is when it is exposed to high levels of UV rays. Such as when prints are exposed to direct sunlight for several months. 

But since most prints are not required to be exposed directly to UV rays for long periods of time, this is not an issue for the majority of users. 

## How to Look for High Quality Third Party Cartridges

Many low-grade third party cartridges are available online. To pick a trusted business, here are the tell-tale signs:

### Check How Long the Company Has Been in Business

The longer the company has been selling cartridges, the more certain are the quality of their cartridges. They also offer less risks as they have more developed policies when it comes to shipping, returns and other conditions. 

### Check the Product Reviews

A customer with a negative product experience is more willing to share their story in the product reviews. Nobody likes to be scammed and will spread their story to prevent others from being exploited too. 

Even customers who have received a faulty cartridge will share how the company handled their issue and for how long. This reflects the customer experience with the company's return policy.

### Check if You can Call or Live Chat for Help

Check the company's website on how they can assist you if you're having problems with their products. A company that you can call for help or live chat with, is more legitimate and is interested in having you as their loyal customer, and is far from making a quick buck from people.
