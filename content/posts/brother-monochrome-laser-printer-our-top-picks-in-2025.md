## **Why Choose a Brother Black and White Laser Printer?**

Brother is known for making high-quality, affordable, and long-lasting printers. Whether you need a Brother compact monochrome laser printer for home or a Brother all-in-one monochrome laser printer for office tasks, these printers offer several advantages:

### **1. Fast Printing Speeds**

Brother monochrome laser printers offer speeds ranging from 26 to 50 pages per minute (ppm), depending on the model. Entry-level printers like the Brother HL-L2350DW print around 32 ppm, while high-end models like the Brother HL-L6400DW can reach 50 ppm, making them ideal for offices that require quick and efficient document printing.

### **2. Lower Printing Costs**

Unlike inkjet printers that rely on expensive ink cartridges, black and white laser printers use toner, which lasts significantly longer. A standard Brother toner cartridge prints around 1,200 pages, while high-yield toner can print 3,000 to 12,000 pages, reducing replacement frequency and long-term costs.

### **3. Sharp Text Quality**

Brother monochrome printers produce crisp, clear text with a resolution of up to 1200 x 1200 dpi, ensuring professional-quality prints for contracts, reports, and business documents. Unlike ink, toner does not smudge or fade, making laser printers a reliable choice for important paperwork.

### **4. Reliable Performance**

Designed for high-volume printing, Brother printers are built to last with durable components and require minimal maintenance. Models like the Brother HL-L2370DW and Brother MFC-L2750DW can handle up to 15,000 pages monthly, making them ideal for offices, schools, and businesses that print frequently.

### **5. Wireless and Mobile Printing**

Many Brother monochrome wireless laser printers have Wi-Fi, AirPrint, and Google Cloud Print, making printing easy. With Wi-Fi, you can print from multiple devices without cables. AirPrint works with iPhones and iPads, while Google Cloud Print supports Chromebooks and Android devices. The [Brother iPrint&Scan app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brother.mfc.brprint&hl=en) also lets you print and scan from your phone, perfect for mobile use.

With their speed, efficiency, and durability, Brother monochrome laser printers are a smart investment for home and office use.

**How to Enable Toner Save Mode?**

* Go to Printer Settings
* Select Print Quality
* Choose Toner Save Mode: ON

A monochrome laser printer prints only in black and white, making it more cost-effective for text-based documents.

If you don’t need color printing, a Brother monochrome laser printer is the better choice for affordability and speed.

### **2. How often do I need to replace toner in a Brother monochrome laser printer?**

It depends on your printing frequency and toner type. A standard toner cartridge lasts around 1,200 pages, while a high-yield toner can print up to 3,000 pages. To extend toner life, enable Toner Save Mode and choose compatible toner cartridges from CompAndSave for cost savings.

### **3. Do Brother monochrome printers support mobile printing?**

Yes, most Brother monochrome wireless laser printers support AirPrint (iPhone), Google Cloud Print, and Brother’s iPrint&Scan app. This allows you to print directly from your smartphone or tablet without needing a computer. Just connect your printer to Wi-Fi, and you can print wirelessly from anywhere in your home or office.
