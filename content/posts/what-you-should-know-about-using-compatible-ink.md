I feel that the time has now come for the world to known about the compatible ink cartridge. I think that for far too long we have been consistently ripped off by the manufacturers of top printer brands, as we feel often pushed into buying there overpriced goods. In some cases the price of the initial printer purchase will cost us quite a bit of money in the first place, why would you want to continue to pour your money into your printer, when you can see the exact same results, when only spending half of the money you probably currently do.

We cannot live without the printer, and ever since the release of this machine they have continued to grow from strength to strength. They help us both at home and in the workplace or office, to complete tasks such as printing the latest images from the last family event, or even printing the latest homework assignment that our children need to complete. Most family households will own a printer and no matter the brand of the printer there will always be an alternative to the genuine ink cartridge and also other printing items.

The Problem that we have is that, to the newbie who has never really used computers, the process of deciding which ink to choose can be a difficult one. The manufacturer of your printer, will no doubt have plenty of money to place into an advertisement campaign for their ink cartridges, this is where many people are drawn in. Right at the very start when you make your purchase you will see that you will always be drawn into buying the genuine or OEM type ink cartridge, as we are told it is the vest and most efficient source of ink for our printer to use. This is just simply not the case, and as mentioned before they are expensive. 

The compatible cartridge offers a very similar service, the difference being that the service and the quality in which is offered comes at a very low cost when you compare both the compatible and the OEM types together. There is no loss in quality and in some cases; the quality may even be better due to the latest in knowledge and technology being used. Printers such as the HP Photo Smart C7288 printer have the potential to use a large amount of ink if it used on a regular basis. You will have also probably paid a large amount of money in your initial purchase of the printer. 

This is nothing against the printer, as they are a quality printer to use, and they are a printer in which I have used myself on many occasions. This is simply a guide on how you can save extra money when using your printer and replacing the ink cartridges you need, for the printer to perform to the best of its ability.
