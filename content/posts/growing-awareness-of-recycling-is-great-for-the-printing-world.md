**Going Green - More and More Recycling Options for Old Cartridges**

A trend beginning to sweep the ink and [toner cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/) industry is the growing desire to make sure old, empty cartridges are properly disposed of. It is estimated that one laser cartridge which is re-manufactured saves nearly 2.5 pounds of metal and plastic from being deposited into landfills. These old cartridges can be reused many times over, and not is it good for the environment but it is also good for you bottom line to use re-manufactured, or reworked, cartridges - they can cost as little as a third of the OEM cartridges and if gotten from a reputable manufacturer and supplier offer as good a print as the OEM models.

It gives recycling a new boost - anything that makes doing business or printing pictures of the grandkids cheaper is great, but when it also helps the environment to recycle your old cartridges it adds another level of happiness to what is already a great deal. There is enough that is easily thrown away in today's world, and these empty old cartridges are almost custom made for an easy remake and rebirth into re-manufactured ink and toner cartridges.

**How Oil Factors In**

Anything made of plastic and metal is gradually getting more and more expensive - it is harder the calculate with cartridges, but think about this - ever tire made uses about 7 gallons of oil, and printer ink and toner cartridges are no different; if it is made of plastic, there is oil involved, and as the price of oil goes up the price of plastic goes up as well. Help get ahead of the curve, and make sure to set your old cartridges aside instead of throwing them away.

**Recycling Saves You Money**

Many companies offer recycling programs, and now you can not only do the right thing but save money as well by buying quality re-manufactured and compatible cartridges that have been meticulously cleaned, checked and refilled so that it is as good as or better than the OEM cartridge that originally came with your printer.
