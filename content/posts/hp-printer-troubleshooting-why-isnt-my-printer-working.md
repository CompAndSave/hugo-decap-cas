Have you recently purchased a new printer? If the answer to this question is yes then there may be a chance that you experience a few teething problems after the initial installation. This is normal and it does not matter which type or brand of printer you buy, there is always going to be that chance that a few small issues could arise. 

One reason that your printer may not be working is that it has not been installed properly to work with your computer. You may think that the installation process is pretty straight forward, however if the instructions are not followed you might miss a vital instruction, which in turn could lead to your printer not being able to work. When you install your printer or the software that comes with your printer onto your computer, all the drivers that are needed to be updated on your computer will be downloaded. Without the correct drivers your printer will not be able to communicate with your computer, therefore the printer will not be able to react to the instructions you issue from your computer.

If you are sure that the installation process went smoothly and have even re-installed the software, then the problem maybe that the drivers for the printer have been installed, but need to be updated. Your computer will normally update all drivers required on a regular basis on its own; however this will depend on your personal settings. There is a way you can do this manually, and you will be able to download all up to date driver online from the HP website. 

Another reason that your printer may not be working could be that you have simply not connected all the wire correctly or that a crucial wire may have come dislodged. The reasons for a printer not working are not always technical and it could even be that you have simply ran out of ink or paper. Make sure to keep an eye on the levels of ink in your ink cartridges, so that you can order more before the ink source runs dry.
