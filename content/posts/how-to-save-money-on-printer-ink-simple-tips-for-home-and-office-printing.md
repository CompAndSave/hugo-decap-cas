Printing at home or in the office is something many of us need to do, but the ink for printers can be really pricey. In fact, printer ink is often considered [one of the most expensive liquids](https://www.compandsave.com/printer-ink-scam-guide) globally, even more costly than fancy champagne. That’s one reason why we are continuously finding affordable ink cartridges! So, in this guide, we will help you how to save money on printer ink without sacrificing the quality of your prints. Let's explore these easy, money-saving tips for your ink cartridges!

## Printer Ink: Reasons Why It Is Expensive!

Ever wonder why printer ink costs a lot? Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or the brand company that made your printer, like HP or Brother, spends a lot on different things, such as research and advertisements. To understand it better, let's take a closer look at each of these factors:

### 1. Research and Development

Companies invest a lot of money in research and development to create advanced ink formulas. Developing inks that deliver vibrant colors, quick drying times, and long-lasting prints adds to the cost.

### 2. Precision Manufacturing

Making ink cartridges needs careful work. It's like paying close attention to every step of creating ink cartridges – from making the ink to putting together the cartridge. This careful process ensures the ink cartridges work well every time. However, doing things so precisely costs more money, and that's one reason why printer ink can be expensive.

### 3. Branding and Ads

Companies spend money to create a well-known brand for their ink and to show it off in ads. The money they spend on these things adds up and makes the ink cost more. So, when you buy printer ink, part of what you're paying for is the effort to make that ink a well-known name.

## How to Save Money on Printer Ink?

Now that you understand why printer ink can be pricey, it's clear that we still buy it because we need it. That's why it's smart to find ways on how to save money on printer ink. To help you with this, check out these simple ways you can do to cut down on printer ink expenses:

### 1. Choose the Right Printer

When you're getting a new printer, choose one known for using cheap ink cartridges. Find models that come with high-yield cartridges or are made for printing that don’t cost a lot. You can also check out this [guide to help you choose the right printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-choose-a-printer-tips-on-selecting-the-best-one-for-you.html) for your needs and budget.

### 2. Print in Draft Mode

When you print in draft mode, it means you're choosing a setting on your printer that uses less ink. It's like a lighter version of printing, where the quality might not be super high, but they get the job done. This is handy for everyday printing that doesn't need to look extra sharp, and the big plus is that it saves you money because it uses less ink each time you print. So, if you don't need super clear and crisp prints, using the draft mode is a smart way to keep your ink expenses down.

### 3. Use Print Preview

By checking the preview, you avoid printing pages with mistakes or things you don't need, saving both paper and ink. It's like giving your document a quick review to ensure it's good to go before hitting the print button. This simple step can save you money by preventing unnecessary prints.

### 4. Regularly Use Your Printer

Regularly using your printer helps prevent the ink nozzles from drying out. If you go for extended periods without printing, the [printhead might get clogged](https://www.compandsave.com/printhead-cleaning-guide) and you may end up using more ink on cleaning cycles. Make it a habit to print a test page or a small document at least once a week to keep your printer in optimal condition. This practice contributes to a smoother printing experience and extends the life of your printer.

### 5. Buy in Bulk

There are companies, such as [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com), which offer quantity discounts when you [purchase ink cartridges in bulk](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360026944932/should-i-buy-printer-cartridges-in-bulk). While the initial cost may be higher, the [cost per page](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-calculate-printing-cost-per-page) tends to be lower, resulting in long-term savings. Also when you buy in bulk, you don't have to order new cartridges as often. It saves you time and makes things easier. So, whether you print a lot for work or personal stuff, this approach is a smart way to spend less and be more efficient.

### 6. Consider Third-Party Ink Cartridge

Explore the option of using compatible or remanufactured ink cartridges. These affordable ink cartridges work the same as the original brand cartridges and can deliver comparable results. Let’s look at each one to know how good they are.

#### **A. Remanufactured Cartridges**

Choosing a [remanufactured ink cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/what-are-remanufactured-ink-cartridges-guide) is a smart way to be eco-friendly and save money.

These cartridges are newly manufactured and made just like the original ones that come with your printer (OEM). Like remanufactured ones, compatible cartridges are checked thoroughly before they're sold. Note that using these types of cartridges [won't void your printer warranty](https://www.compandsave.com/help/articles/360015776352/will-using-these-cartridges-void-my-warranty).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Are remanufactured cartridges as good as OEM cartridges?

Yes, [remanufactured ink and toner cartridges are just as good as OEM cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/are-remanufactured-ink-cartridges-good-guide?view=abc/). They go through thorough testing to make sure they work well. These cartridges are a cost-effective option and perform at the same level as the original ones, which are a reliable choice for quality printing. Choosing remanufactured cartridges helps you save money without compromising on performance.

### 2. Is it worth investing in an ink subscription service?

There are printer manufacturers, like HP, that offer monthly plans for ink subscriptions. While it may be convenient to have ink delivered regularly, you must consider your printing needs and frequency. If you print often, the subscription can save you time and money. However, evaluating the cost-effectiveness and necessity is essential for occasional users before committing to a subscription.

### 3. Does printing in draft mode affect print quality?

Yes, printing in draft mode can affect print quality. Draft mode is designed for quick and less resource-intensive printing, which often results in lighter prints with less detail. While it's suitable for simple documents or drafts, it may not provide the best quality for images or important documents. If print quality is a priority, it's recommended to use higher-quality settings for better results, even though it may take a bit more time and use more ink. Always consider the purpose of the print job and adjust the settings accordingly for the desired outcome.

### 4. How often should I clean my printer's printhead?

You should clean your printer's printhead regularly to maintain optimal performance. For most printers, cleaning it every few weeks or at least once a month is a good practice. However, if you notice print quality issues like streaks or faded colors, cleaning the printhead sooner can help address these issues. Following your printer's manual or guidelines for printhead maintenance is also recommended for the best results. You can also follow this guide for [printhead cleaning automatically or manually](https://www.compandsave.com/printhead-cleaning-guide).

### 5. How can I store ink cartridges to maximize their shelf life?

To make cheap printer ink and toner cartridges last longer, [store them properly](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-store-printer-ink-cartridges) in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight. Keep them sealed in their original packaging until you're ready to use them. If you've opened a cartridge but don't need it immediately, store it in an airtight container to prevent drying. Avoid exposing cartridges to extreme temperatures, as this can affect their performance.
