## How To Pick A Printer: Things To Consider Before Purchasing

To make sure you get the printer model that best meets your needs, there are a few important things to think about before making a purchase. Here is a comprehensive to help you make decisions:



### **1. Purpose and Usage**

* **Home vs. Office:** Choose whether to utilize the printer for business, personal, or home office use. This will help you decide the type and features you need.
* **Frequency of Printing:** Think about how frequently you plan to print. An inkjet printer might be better suitable for occasional use, but a laser printer might be more effective for large volumes of printing.

### 2. Types of Printer

* **Inkjet Printers** - These printers are best for printing color papers and are perfect for usage at home.
* **Laser printers** - Usually more economical and quicker for publications with lots of text. Ideal for workplace settings where print quantities are larger.
* **All-in-One printers** - Contains extra features including faxing, copying, and scanning. This is beneficial for people who require multiple functions from a single device.

### 3. Print Quality

* Do you print photos most of the time? If yes, evaluate the printer's resolution measured in dots per inch or dpi when choosing a printer, to ensure it meets your quality requirements for text and images. This also measures how many ink droplets are utilized to print one image. A higher DPI yields more dots per inch, which improves detail and produces a crisper, clearer image. That being said, you will need a [high-resolution printer especially for photos](https://medium.com/compandsave/best-printers-for-photo-printing-top-picks-for-stunning-photo-prints-0d0166ebbfd5) if you want to have clear and detailed prints. 

### 4. Connectivity Options

* **Wired Connections:** If you are looking for a much more stable connection and not being bothered with wires, then this option is something you would want to consider. These [printers use USB cable](https://www.compandsave.com/nsearch/?q=printer+cable) or Ethernet cable when connected to your computer or other devices.
* **Wireless Connectivity:** The ability to print from various devices and place the printer anywhere is made possible by Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Choose a printer with this kind of connectivity option if you often use a laptop, tablet or phone when printing.
* **Mobile and Cloud Printing:** Features like AirPrint, Google Cloud Print, or proprietary apps can enhance convenience.

### 5. Operation Cost

* **Costs associated with Ink and Toner:** One of the things to consider on how to choose a printer is by examining the yield and price of ink and toner cartridges, as these can have a big impact on the total cost of ownership over time. Some printers might be cheaper upfront, but the cost of ink or toner can add up in the long run. Other printers with slightly higher upfront costs might have lower ongoing expenses because their ink or toner is more budget-friendly. Also, try to consider the [compatible and remanufactured cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-knowledge-base) which are more affordable than the original ones to save more money on ink.

### 6. Speed

* **Print Speed:** Check the printer's pages-per-minute (ppm) to make sure it can print at the pace you require, particularly if you frequently need to print large documents. If you’re printing a lot or in a hurry, a higher PPM is good. But if you’re not in a rush all the time, a slower printer might be just fine and usually comes with a lower price tag.

### 7. Multifunction Features

* Multifunction features in a printer mean it can do more than just print. It is often called an MFP (multifunction printer) that can scan, copy, and sometimes even fax documents. So, if you’re short on space or want to simplify your workspace by having one machine to do several tasks, a multifunction printer could be a good choice. Consider if you’d benefit from these extra functions before choosing your printer.

### 8. Brand Reputation

* Before buying a printer, you must do your research. One thing to consider on how to pick a printer is the reputation of the brand for reliability, customer support, and the availability of replacement parts and consumables. Check out what other people say about the brand in reviews to get an idea of what it’s like to use that specific printer model. A brand with a good reputation is more likely to give you a printer that works well and lasts a long time.



## How To Choose A Printer: Learning Facts Between InkJet and Laser

One crucial thing on how to choose the right printer is learning the advantages and disadvantages of both types of printers between inkjet and laser printing. This stage will help you decide which best meets your demands. So, here is a thorough comparison to assist you in making a decision:



### InkJet Printers

**Advantages:**

**1. Versatility**

* **Photo Quality:** High-quality photos and color documents can be produced by inkjet printers, which are known for their exceptional color accuracy. They print photos which makes them ideal for photos and detailed graphics.
* **Types of Paper:** They can print on various media types, including glossy, matte photo paper and even some fabrics.
* **Paper size:** Inkjet printers are capable of using paper sizes of all kinds—large, small, and medium.

**2. Lower Upfront Cost**

* **Initial Cost:** Compared to laser printers, inkjet printers are typically less expensive to buy, which makes them more affordable for homes or small offices on a tight budget.

**3. Compact Size**

* **Space-saving:** Because many inkjet printers are smaller in size, they can be used in cramped spaces at home or in small offices.



**Disadvantages:**

**1. Operational Cost/Consumables**

* **Ink Cartridges:** Compared to laser printers, the cost of replacement ink cartridges can be greater and more expensive due to its lower ink volume and lower page yield. If you print a lot, you might need to replace it frequently. On the other hand, if you don’t use the printer regularly, the ink can dry up or clog the nozzles.

**2. Printing Speed**

* **Slower Output:** When printing huge documents, high-resolution images or in large quantities, inkjet printers often print more slowly than laser printers.

**3. Smudging of Ink**

* **Drying Time:** Inkjet printers use dye or pigment-based inks. If inkjet printouts are not handled carefully, especially if you use cheap or non-dryfast ink, they may smear.



### Laser Printers

**Advantages:**



**1. Printing Speed**

* **Faster Output:** When printing large amounts of text, laser printers typically outperform inkjet printers in terms of speed.

**2. Operational Cost/Consumables**

* **Cost per Page:** Since toner cartridges yield more pages per cartridge and have a lower cost per page over time, they are more cost-effective in the long run.

**3. Printing Quality**

* **Text Quality:** They are excellent at sharp and clear text, which is perfect for reports and business papers.

**Disadvantages:**

**1. Higher Upfront Cost**

* **Initial Cost:** Generally, Laser Printers are much more expensive than inkjet printers, and toners have a higher price tag than inkjet cartridges.

**2. Color Quality:**

* **Photo and Media Quality:** Although color laser printers are available, their photo quality frequently falls short of that of inkjets as high-quality photographs work better with them. Also, most laser printers can’t handle the same variety of paper  especially for photos that inkjets can.

**3. Printer Size:**

* **Not Space Saver:** If you have limited room, you may want to take into account that laser printers might be heavier and more bulky than inkjet printers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How to choose the right printer between inkjet and laser?

Choosing between inkjet and laser printers depends on what you need. Inkjet printers are good for colorful pictures and regular documents. Consider this type of printer if you want something versatile. On the other hand, laser printers are better for lots of text and quick printing. If you print a lot of pictures, go for inkjet, but for a lot of text, a laser printer is a good choice. Think about what you print the most to pick the best type for you.



### 2. Is printing speed an essential factor, and how do I choose the right PPM (pages per minute)?

Yes, printing speed is essential, especially if you need to print a lot of pages quickly. When choosing the right PPM (pages per minute), think about how fast you want your printer to work. For home users or small offices with moderate printing needs, a printer with a PPM ranging from 20 to 40 can be sufficient. If you have high-volume printing requirements or work in a fast-paced environment, you might consider printers with PPM above 40 for more efficient output.  Consider your needs and how quickly you want your documents ready when picking a printer with the right PPM for you.



### 3. How important is DPI (dots per inch) in printer specifications?

DPI, or dots per inch, is important in printer specs because it tells you how sharp and detailed your prints will be. The higher the DPI, the more dots of ink or toner a printer can put in a square inch. If you want clear and detailed prints, look for a higher DPI. For most everyday printing needs, a DPI of 600 to 1200 is usually good enough. Remember, a higher DPI can make your photos and documents look better, but it might slow down the printing a bit.



### 4. Can I use any kind of paper with my printer, or does it need specific types? 

It's important to use the right kind of paper for your printer. Check the manual to see what types and sizes of paper your printer can handle. Some printers work best with plain paper, while others can use glossy or photo paper. Using the wrong kind of paper might cause printing problems. Make sure to load the paper correctly in the tray, and if you're not sure, the printer manual will have all the details you need.



### 5. Why is it important to know the cost per page of a printer cartridge?

Knowing the cost per page of a printer cartridge is crucial for budget management, understanding the printer’s efficiency, and predicting the total ownership cost. By comparing cost per page, you can choose a printer that offers a better balance between initial cost and long-term expenses particularly useful for high-volume printing scenarios.
