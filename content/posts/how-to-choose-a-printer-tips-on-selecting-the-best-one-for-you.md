## How to Choose a Printer: Things to Consider Before Buying

Printers are helpful when we want to print stuff at home for work or even family photos. They have different features that are available depending on your needs. To help you how to choose a printer, here are some things you need to consider before buying:

### 1. Printer Type

When you choose a printer, think about the type that suits your needs. There are mainly two types: inkjet and laser printers. Inkjet printers are good for various things like photos and regular documents. They're flexible but might be a bit slower. On the other hand, laser printers are faster, especially for lots of text printing, but they are usually better for documents rather than photos. So, decide what you'll be printing more of—photos or documents—and pick the type that fits your printing needs.

### 2. Print Quality

Consider how good you want your prints to look, and that's what print quality is about. If you want clear and detailed prints, you'll need a printer with high resolution. High-resolution printers can make your photos and documents look better because they can show more details. So, if you plan to print many pictures or need sharp text in your documents, choosing a printer with good print quality, often measured in dots per inch (DPI), is a smart idea. Just check the printer's specifications for its DPI to make sure it meets your expectations for how nice you want your prints to be.

### 3. Printing Speed

When you're thinking about printing speed, it's all about how fast or slow your printer can make copies. If you need things printed quickly, you might want to look for a printer with a higher pages-per-minute (PPM) rating. That number tells you how many pages the printer can spit out in a minute. So, if you're printing a lot or in a hurry, a higher PPM is good. But if you're not in a rush all the time, a slower printer might be just fine and usually comes with a lower price tag. 

### 4. Connectivity Options

When you're checking out connectivity options for a printer, it's like looking at how the printer connects to your devices. There are different ways a printer can connect. Some printers can connect wirelessly, which is handy if you want to print from a laptop, phone, or tablet without plugging in cables. Others connect using [printer USB cable](https://www.compandsave.com/nsearch/?q=printer+cable), which you probably use for many devices. And there are printers that use Ethernet, which is a bit like a wired network connection. So, think about how you like to connect things and choose a printer that plays well with your devices, whether it's wirelessly, through USB, or with an Ethernet cable.

### 5. Multifunction Features

Multifunction features in a printer mean it can do more than just print. It is often called an MFP (multifunction printer) that can scan, copy, and sometimes even fax documents. So, if you're short on space or want to simplify your workspace by having one machine to do several tasks, a multifunction printer could be a good choice. Consider if you'd benefit from these extra functions before choosing your printer.

### 6. Ink or Toner Costs

Consider how much it will cost to keep your printer running smoothly. Some printers might be cheaper upfront, but the cost of ink or toner can add up over time. Check the prices of the ink or toner cartridges for the printer you're interested in. Sometimes, printers with slightly higher upfront costs might have lower ongoing expenses because their ink or toner is more budget-friendly. You can also use [compatible and remanufactured cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-knowledge-base) that are more affordable than the original ones to save more money on ink. So, consider the long run and how much you plan to print when deciding on a printer.

### 7. Brand Reputation

Before buying a printer, you must do your research. Consider the reputation of the printer brand for reliability, customer support, and the availability of replacement parts and consumables. Check out what other people say about the brand in reviews to get an idea of what it's like to use that specific printer model. A brand with a good reputation is more likely to give you a printer that works well and lasts a long time.

## Choosing Printer: Inkjet vs. Laser Printer

So now that we have tackled some things you might consider before choosing printer, let’s find out what would be best for you - an [inkjet or a laser printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-inkjet-printers.html).
