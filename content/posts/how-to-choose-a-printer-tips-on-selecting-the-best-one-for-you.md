Our guide is here to help. We'll share some easy tips on choosing printer types, making it simpler for you to decide. Let's dive into the details and select the best one with confidence!

**In this guide, we will discuss:**

* How to Choose a Printer: Things to Consider Before Buying
* Choosing Printer: Inkjet vs. Laser Printer

## How to Choose a Printer: Things to Consider Before Buying

Printers are helpful when we want to print stuff at home for work or even family photos. They have different features that are available depending on your needs. To help you how to choose a printer, here are some things you need to consider before buying:

### 1. Printer Type

When you choose a printer, think about the type that suits your needs. There are mainly two types: inkjet and laser printers. Inkjet printers are good for various things like photos and regular documents. They're flexible but might be a bit slower. On the other hand, laser printers are faster, especially for lots of text printing, but they are usually better for documents rather than photos. So, decide what you'll be printing more of—photos or documents—and pick the type that fits your printing needs.

### 2. Print Quality

Consider how good you want your prints to look, and that's what print quality is about. If you want clear and detailed prints, you'll need a printer with high resolution. High-resolution printers can make your photos and documents look better because they can show more details. So, if you plan to print many pictures or need sharp text in your documents, choosing a printer with good print quality, often measured in dots per inch (DPI), is a smart idea. Just check the printer's specifications for its DPI to make sure it meets your expectations for how nice you want your prints to be.

### 3. Printing Speed

When you're thinking about printing speed, it's all about how fast or slow your printer can make copies. If you need things printed quickly, you might want to look for a printer with a higher pages-per-minute (PPM) rating. That number tells you how many pages the printer can spit out in a minute. So, if you're printing a lot or in a hurry, a higher PPM is good. But if you're not in a rush all the time, a slower printer might be just fine and usually comes with a lower price tag. 

### 4. Connectivity Options

When you're checking out connectivity options for a printer, it's like looking at how the printer connects to your devices. There are different ways a printer can connect. Some printers can connect wirelessly, which is handy if you want to print from a laptop, phone, or tablet without plugging in cables. Others connect using [printer USB cable](https://www.compandsave.com/nsearch/?q=printer+cable), which you probably use for many devices. And there are printers that use Ethernet, which is a bit like a wired network connection. So, think about how you like to connect things and choose a printer that plays well with your devices, whether it's wirelessly, through USB, or with an Ethernet cable.

### 5. Multifunction Features

Multifunction features in a printer mean it can do more than just print. It is often called an MFP (multifunction printer) that can scan, copy, and sometimes even fax documents. So, if you're short on space or want to simplify your workspace by having one machine to do several tasks, a multifunction printer could be a good choice. Consider if you'd benefit from these extra functions before choosing your printer.

### 6. Ink or Toner Costs

Consider how much it will cost to keep your printer running smoothly. Some printers might be cheaper upfront, but the cost of ink or toner can add up over time. Check the prices of the ink or toner cartridges for the printer you're interested in. Sometimes, printers with slightly higher upfront costs might have lower ongoing expenses because their ink or toner is more budget-friendly. You can also use [compatible and remanufactured cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-knowledge-base) that are more affordable than the original ones to save more money on ink. So, consider the long run and how much you plan to print when deciding on a printer.

### 7. Brand Reputation

Before buying a printer, you must do your research. Consider the reputation of the printer brand for reliability, customer support, and the availability of replacement parts and consumables. Check out what other people say about the brand in reviews to get an idea of what it's like to use that specific printer model. A brand with a good reputation is more likely to give you a printer that works well and lasts a long time.

## Choosing Printer: Inkjet vs. Laser Printer

So now that we have tackled some things you might consider before choosing printer, let’s find out what would be best for you - an [inkjet or a laser printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-inkjet-printers.html). To help you how to select printer, here are some pros and cons of each: 

### Inkjet Printers

#### **PROS:**

* **High-Quality Photo Printing:** Inkjet printers are known for producing vibrant and high-resolution photo prints, making them ideal for photography enthusiasts.
* **Color Variety:** Inkjet printers can reproduce various colors, allowing for accurate and detailed color prints.
* **Compact Size:** Inkjet printers are generally smaller and more compact, making them suitable for home offices and smaller spaces.
* **Affordability:** They are often more budget-friendly than laser printers, making them accessible to casual users.
* **Versatility in Media:** Inkjet printers can handle various types of media, including different paper types and sizes, as well as specialty papers like [photo papers](https://www.compandsave.com/photography-paper-for-inkjet-printer-guide#photo_paper) or [transfer papers](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/transfer-paper).
* **Quiet Operation:** Inkjet printers tend to operate more quietly than laser printers, making them suitable for quiet environments.
* **Wireless Connectivity:** Many inkjet printers offer wireless connectivity options, allowing for convenient printing from various devices without needing physical connections.
* **Refillable Ink:** [Refilling your cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-refill-ink-cartridges-guide) using [ink refill kits](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-refill-bulk-ink) can reduce the cost of printing.

#### **CONS:**

* **Ink Cost:** Ink cartridges for inkjet printers can be expensive, and the [cost per page](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-calculate-printing-cost-per-page) may be higher compared to laser printers, especially for high-volume printing. 
* **Slow Printing Speed:** Inkjet printers are generally slower in terms of pages per minute (PPM) than laser printers, making them less suitable for high-volume printing.
* **Prone to Clogs:** Inkjet printheads can get clogged, leading to print quality issues. Regular maintenance, including [printhead cleaning](https://www.compandsave.com/printhead-cleaning-guide), may be required to prevent and fix the problem.
* **Limited Text Quality:** While suitable for most text documents, inkjet printers may not provide the same sharpness and clarity as laser printers for text-heavy printing.
* **Higher Cost for High-Volume Printing:** For users with high printing volumes, the ongoing cost of ink cartridges can add up quickly, making inkjet printers less cost-effective in the long run.
* **Limited Paper Tray Capacity:** Low-capacity paper trays of 50 to 100 sheets which can be frustrating for a user who prints a lot.

### Laser Printers

#### **PROS:** 

* **Fast Printing Speed:** Laser printers are known for their high-speed printing, making them suitable for large-volume printing tasks in a shorter time.
* **High Text Quality:** Laser printers excel in producing sharp and clear text, making them ideal for text-heavy documents and professional-looking prints.
* **Lower Cost Per Page:** Laser printers generally have a lower cost per page compared to inkjet printers, especially for high-volume printing, due to the efficiency of toner cartridges.
* **Low Maintenance:** Laser printers have fewer moving parts and generally require less maintenance than inkjet printers. Toner cartridges have a longer lifespan than ink cartridges.
* **Smudge-Resistant Prints:** Prints from laser printers are less prone to smudging since the toner is dry powder that adheres to the paper quickly.

#### **CONS:**

* **Higher Initial Cost:** Laser printers typically have a higher upfront cost compared to inkjet printers, which can be a consideration for budget-conscious consumers.
* **Limited Color Options:** While color laser printers exist, they are generally more expensive, and the color quality may not match that of high-quality inkjet prints.
* **Bulkier Design:** Although there are some compact laser printers on the market, they are generally bigger and heavier than inkjet printers.
* **Warm-Up Time:** Laser printers may have a brief warm-up period before they start printing, which can be a consideration for users needing quick, on-demand printing.
* **Toner Replacement Cost:** While toner cartridges last longer, their replacement cost can be higher than ink cartridges.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How do I choose a printer - inkjet or laser printer? 

Choosing between inkjet and laser printers depends on what you need. Inkjet printers are good for colorful pictures and regular documents. Consider this type of printer if you want something versatile. On the other hand, laser printers are better for lots of text and quick printing. If you print a lot of pictures, go for inkjet, but for a lot of text, a laser printer is a good choice. Think about what you print the most to pick the best type for you.

### 2. Is printing speed an essential factor, and how do I choose the right PPM (pages per minute)?

Yes, printing speed is essential, especially if you need to print a lot of pages quickly. When choosing the right PPM (pages per minute), think about how fast you want your printer to work. For home users or small offices with moderate printing needs, a printer with a PPM ranging from 20 to 40 can be sufficient. If you have high-volume printing requirements or work in a fast-paced environment, you might consider printers with PPM above 40 for more efficient output.  Consider your needs and how quickly you want your documents ready when picking a printer with the right PPM for you.

### 3. How important is DPI (dots per inch) in printer specifications?

DPI, or dots per inch, is important in printer specs because it tells you how sharp and detailed your prints will be. The higher the DPI, the more dots of ink or toner a printer can put in a square inch. If you want clear and detailed prints, look for a higher DPI. For most everyday printing needs, a DPI of 600 to 1200 is usually good enough. Remember, a higher DPI can make your photos and documents look better, but it might slow down the printing a bit.

### 4. How do I know if a printer is energy-efficient, and why is it important?

You can find out if a printer is energy-efficient by checking for labels like ENERGY STAR. These labels mean the printer uses less electricity, which is good for the environment and your energy bills. Look for printers with sleep mode features that use less power when not printing. Energy-efficient printers help reduce carbon emissions and save resources. Choosing an energy-efficient printer is important for being eco-friendly and saving on electricity costs over time.

### 5. Can I use any kind of paper with my printer, or does it need specific types? 

It's important to use the right kind of paper for your printer. Check the manual to see what types and sizes of paper your printer can handle. Some printers work best with plain paper, while others can use [glossy or photo paper](https://www.compandsave.com/photography-paper-for-inkjet-printer-guide#photo_paper). Using the wrong kind of paper might cause printing problems. Make sure to load the paper correctly in the tray, and if you're not sure, the printer manual will have all the details you need.
