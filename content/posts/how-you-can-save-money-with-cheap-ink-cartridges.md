Despite what original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) tell you, discount printer ink doesn't lead to poorer printing or copying results. Remanufactured ink cartridges and compatible ink cartridges are just as good as OEM ones. Many types of customers are consistently pleased with using non-OEM ink to print everyday documents, tax reports, professional photos, marketing materials, and much more. Keep reading to learn how to get your ink cartridges cheap without sacrificing quality.  

## OEM Unmasked

First, let's define what "OEM" means. An OEM is the company that made the initial product, which in this case is your printer. For example, if you bought an HP, Brother, or Lexmark printer, those companies would be considered OEM. 

You can continue to purchase ink made by OEMs, but the prices are often very expensive. Generally, their [business model](https://blog.compandsave.com/2016/09/the-truth-about-printers.html) is to sell printers cheaply while offering the replacement ink at high costs. Remanufactured and compatible printer cartridges on the other hand are sold for much less so you can save a bundle compared to OEM cartridges. 

## Remanufactured Cartridges 

Now that you've decided to stop buying OEM ink cartridges, you need to determine which discount ink cartridges you want to use.

A remanufactured ink cartridge is the right choice if you are interested in conserving environmental resources and saving money. Did you know that a remanufactured cartridge costs up to 80% less than an OEM cartridge? And since this refurbished cartridge conserves the rubber, plastic, steel, and aluminum that would otherwise make a new cartridge, it prevents more non-biodegradable material in our landfills.

So what about quality? Can these [cheap ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/) handle large print jobs and color printing? Absolutely! You can depend on remanufactured cartridges for your printing and copying tasks. Remanufactured cartridges are thoroughly checked for possible leakage and completely cleaned, including the printhead nozzles. Inspectors also replace worn components and test electrical circuitry. 

## Compatible Cartridges

Just because they are cheap printer cartridges in terms of cost doesn't mean that compatible cartridges are inferior to OEM printer cartridges. New compatible cartridges are assembled exactly like OEMs. As with remanufactured cartridges, compatible ones are fully inspected before stocking, will never void your printer's warranty, and function the same way as OEM cartridges.
