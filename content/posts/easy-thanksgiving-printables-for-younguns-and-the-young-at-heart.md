Get ready for Thanksgiving with some fun, creative, and inexpensive activities your whole family will enjoy. Sure, Thanksgiving is all about the turkey, sides, and pies. Cooking and eating delicious food together no doubt bring smiles and laughs (and maybe naps) to your family and friends. But you can begin creating those special memories before Thanksgiving by making our Thanksgiving printables decorations. Our printable Thanksgiving placemats will even occupy your kiddos during Thanksgiving dinner.  

## Thanksgiving Printables for Your Whole Family

### Turkey Origami Printable

Make one or several of our turkey printables. Use one as a centerpiece on your Thanksgiving dinner table or scatter a few around the table for decoration. You can even have a "Thanksgiving hunt" using the turkey origamis. Place them around your house or outside, weather permitting. Then, let the children hunt for the turkeys with a small prize awarded to whoever finds the most turkeys. This would be a good activity to do after the main Thanksgiving dinner and before dessert, giving kids time to run around and play for a while.

The turkey origami printable only takes 16 simple steps to complete and just requires scissors, two sheets of paper, a printer, and [colored ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com).

### Thanksgiving Placemat Printables

We have two Thanksgiving placemats you can easily print out before your Thanksgiving feast. Both will keep the young'uns (and the young at heart) occupied during dinner. 

The first one fits perfectly with a plate, glass, and silverware. You'll find a fun tic-tac-toe game on the second page. Print the placemat here: [Thanksgiving Placemat](https://www.compandsave.com/v/mp/cas%5Fblog/cas-small-placemat.pdf)

The second placemat printable is a large Thanksgiving turkey with a bunch of games on the second page. There is even Sudoku, perfect for teenagers and really any other guest who likes games. Make it competitive after dinner and see who completes both Sudoku puzzles first. Print the placemat and games here: [Thanksgiving Printable](https://www.compandsave.com/v/mp/cas%5Fblog/placemat-cas.pdf)

Both placemats also serve as coloring activities for your kids or you can use colored ink instead when printing them out. You can print the placemats double sided or as two pages each.

Now that you have some easy ideas to keep your guests entertained during the festivities, all you have to do is kick back and eat. Everyone here at [CompAndSave.com](https://www.compandsave.com) wishes you a very happy Thanksgiving!
