## How to Create a Business Card? 5 Super Simple Steps

Can you print business cards at home? Definitely! With the right tools and instructions, you'll print your first card in no time. Just follow these five super simple steps that will help you make homemade business cards.

### **STEP 1: Selecting the Paper for Business Cards**

[![Paper for Business Cards](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.19.20 am.png "Paper for Business Cards")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.19.20 am.png)

Choosing the right paper for business card printing is essential for a professional look. There are some crucial things you need to consider before making your choice, such as the type of paper, card size, etc. Let's discuss them below.

**Pick the Paper Size**

When printing your DIY business cards, choose a size that will look great on the cardholder you have chosen. The standard length of a U.S. business card is 3.5 inches by 2 inches. You can cut your cardstock to the appropriate size.

**Select a Paper Color**

It's exciting to choose your brand colors for your custom business cards. The most common colors used are cream, off-white, and white. But, you can choose bolder colors if you want to. Make sure that it's similar to your brand colors.

**Choose Your Paper Stock**

The most crucial factor is the quality of the paper. Make sure it's high-quality and thick enough to give your cards a sturdy appearance. The best paper for printing business cards at home is cardstock. You can buy regular cardstock, which costs the least. Or, you can purchase premium cardstock for a little extra money. And if you want something extra fancy, try exploring plastic card stock. However, check your printer before getting plastic stock, as not all of them print on plastic.

**Thickness and Weight**

How thick is a business card? The thickness should be at least 14 pt or 0.014 inches so that all printing will appear uniform and legible. Make sure to choose heavyweight paper (at least 200-340 GSM) so your cards have a premium look and feel. The GSM (grams per square meter) is important since thicker cardstock is sturdier. Since business cards are carried around for a long time, they need to be able to handle rough treatment.

**Finish**

There are mainly two types of paper to print business cards at home. You can choose between [glossy and matte](https://medium.com/compandsave/glossy-vs-matte-photo-paper-which-is-better-500028110dfe) . If your card has a combination of different colors or graphics, go for a glossy finish, as this will make things pop. However, the matte finish is perfect for cards with primarily black text and graphics.

**Printing Type**

Are you going to print on just one side or both sides? Regular cardstock will work fine for the former, but for the latter, you need a special double-sided printing cardstock that's not see-through or has the ink bleeding through it.

**\*TIP:** If you want to go an extra mile on the fanciness meter, try exploring linen or textured cardstocks . Explore different kinds of paper for your printing projects.*

### STEP 2: Deciding on Business Card Information Layout

[![Business Card Information Layout](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.22.30 am.png "Business Card Information Layout")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.22.30 am.png)

When designing a business card, the first thing that needs to be done is to decide what information should be in it. Here are a few things to consider:

**Name**

This is an essential part of your card and should be in a large, easy-to-read font.

**Job Title**

Your business card is a way to introduce yourself to many people, so make sure to put what you do on it.

**Contact Info**

Include your business phone number and email address. Feel free to include the website URL of your brand as well.

**Social Media Links**

If you're active on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, consider including their handles at the bottom or at the back. You can also add QR codes for your social media handles at the back of your card.

**Personalization**

If you're looking to stand out from your coworkers or just have a unique card in general, consider adding a small headshot, a slogan, or even a quote from you when designing a business card..

### STEP 3: Designing a Business Card

[![Designing a Business Card](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.24.27 am.png "Designing a Business Card")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.24.27 am.png)

Business cards made at home can look high-quality with suitable designs. Now you'll need to choose the elements for your business card printing. This includes fonts, colors, graphics, etc. Let's discuss them below.

**Decide on a Logo**

A good logo should be fairly easy to spot and recognize, look modern and elegant, and reflect your brand. If you don't have the resources or time to design a logo, consider getting help from a professional graphic designer.

**Pick a Color Scheme**

First, pick a color scheme that will be the dominant one on the cards. For example, you might go for a light blue as the base color, with different shades of purple or green used sparingly. Furthermore, you can go with bold colors or less saturated versions so that they'll look more natural on different printers. To help you decide, you can check out color palette generators, such as [Canva business cards](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). And lastly, consider using textures or patterns to add some extra visual interest.

**Choose a Font(s)**

Next, it's important to choose a font that is both legible and eye-catching. We recommend using a typeface such as Arial or Verdana, which are ideal for printing business card information.

**Graphics**

You can use photos, graphics files, or even handwritten notes for your cards. However, be sure to choose high-resolution files so that they'll print nicely without any errors.

**Layout**

Finally, decide on a layout for your cards. You can go with a classic design or something more creative and unique. Consider the overall look of your card—do you want it simple and minimalistic or flashy? The choice is yours!

**\*TIP:** Take inspiration from various business cards in your industry. Make sure to keep your card sleek and modern while still reflecting your brand. Lastly, ensure all the text on your cards is legible and easy enough for people to read at a distance.*

### STEP 4: Choosing the Designing App

[![Choosing the Designing App](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.26.52 am.png "Choosing the Designing App")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.26.52 am.png)

Now, there are tools that you can use to creatively design your business cards. You can start from scratch or get free templates. If you have the skills to create your own graphics, feel free to use software that will allow you to do so.

**DIY Business Cards From Scratch**

Here are some tools you can use to make business cards from scratch:

**1. Microsoft Word**

How to print business cards in Word? It's super easy just by utilizing the different fonts or inserting images and shapes. It's best for non-tech-savvy people as it has limited but simple controls.

**2. Adobe Illustrator**

Perfect for people with a little knowledge of graphic design and those who can make cards with software. You have the freedom to design your card however you want.

**\*TIP:** You can also view YouTube tutorials for business card making for the specific designing software you're using.*

**Free Business Card Maker**

Learning how to print business cards at home can be a cost-effective way to get the cards you need without breaking the bank. On the other hand, if you want to save time, there are free templates that you can use. Where to get free business cards templates to print at home? There are a ton of places on the internet where you can find free business card templates to print, such as:

**1. Canva**

How to print business cards from Canva at home? Simply choose or type business cards in the search bar. Canva offers various design options and allows you to create creative and professional cards. With many templates and designs to choose from, it's easy to find one that suits your needs perfectly.

**2. Freepik**

Another free template you can try is Freepik. It has millions of stock images that you can use without spending a cent. Get inspired by various designs as you start to create your own business cards.

**3. Adobe Express**

This is a free online version of Adobe Photoshop—best for those who don't have the software installed. It has thousands of templates you can choose from. It's the best choice if you're not yet confident with your Photoshop skills.

**\*TIP:** Before downloading free business card templates, check the quality and printing specifications to ensure the custom business cards will print correctly and look how you want them to. Also, make sure they're royalty-free and can be used for commercial purposes, as you don't want a lawsuit filed for copyright later.*

**Have a Graphic Designer Do It**

Alternatively, you can outsource the designing bit to someone professional, like a graphic designer with skills in business card design. A skilled person can make custom business cards that look polished and professional and don't cost an arm and a leg. Plus, they'll likely have access to more premium templates and designs than you will at home. Try searching for graphic designers on Fiverr, Design Crowd, People Per Hour, or Upwork. You can discuss what you want with the artist, and they can send you the design so you can make your own business cards at home.

## Business Card Printer Buying Guide

If you're planning on printing your business cards at home, it's important to do some research and purchase the right printer for the task. There are a few key things to consider when purchasing a business card printer:

### Compatibility

Most printers are made to handle standard paper, which is 80 gsm. On the other hand, business cards have a heavier weight, ranging between 200 and 340 GSM. So make sure to buy a compatible printer.

### Print quality

To get high-quality prints, ensure your printer is capable of producing at least 300 dpi resolution.

### Print speed

Most printers can print business cards quickly; however, if you go for a higher DPI like 300-600, it will take some time to print. So if the printer is faster, the less time you'll have to spend waiting for prints.

### Paper type

Most business card paper has a synthetic coating that helps cut down on glare and keeps the colors on the card true. Some printers are not compatible with this type of paper, so be sure to choose one that is before buying.

### Size

Since you're going to print business cards at home, you need a smaller printer than those giants in the commercial printing business.

### Laser or Inkjet

Both kinds of printers can print DIY business cards at home, but using an inkjet is more convenient. Inkjets are great for printing in colors, graphics, and on a wide variety of paper sizes. Laser printers can sometimes curl the card due to heat. So you will have to place cards under some heavy objects like books to straighten them out. Determine whether an inkjet or laser is the best printer for your project.

### Connectivity

location. It's nice to have if you want the printer to start printing when you're away from home, so you don't have to sit down and wait for prints to come out. You can also directly print from your mobile devices with ease.

**\*TIP:** Make sure to test the printer before printing your cards to ensure it is exactly the one you need for your DIY business card making. With a little bit of effort, printing business cards at home can be a breeze!*
