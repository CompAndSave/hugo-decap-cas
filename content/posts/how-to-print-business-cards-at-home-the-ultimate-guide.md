## How to Create a Business Card? 5 Super Simple Steps

Can you print business cards at home? Definitely! With the right tools and instructions, you'll print your first card in no time. Just follow these five super simple steps that will help you make homemade business cards.

### **STEP 1: Selecting the Paper for Business Cards**

[![Paper for Business Cards](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.19.20 am.png "Paper for Business Cards")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-12.19.20 am.png)

Choosing the right paper for business card printing is essential for a professional look. There are some crucial things you need to consider before making your choice, such as the type of paper, card size, etc. Let's discuss them below.

**Pick the Paper Size**

When printing your DIY business cards, choose a size that will look great on the cardholder you have chosen. The standard length of a U.S. business card is 3.5 inches by 2 inches. You can cut your cardstock to the appropriate size.

**Select a Paper Color**

It's exciting to choose your brand colors for your custom business cards. The most common colors used are cream, off-white, and white. But, you can choose bolder colors if you want to. Make sure that it's similar to your brand colors.

**Choose Your Paper Stock**

The most crucial factor is the quality of the paper. Make sure it's high-quality and thick enough to give your cards a sturdy appearance. The best paper for printing business cards at home is cardstock. You can buy regular cardstock, which costs the least. Or, you can purchase premium cardstock for a little extra money. And if you want something extra fancy, try exploring plastic card stock. However, check your printer before getting plastic stock, as not all of them print on plastic.

**Thickness and Weight**

How thick is a business card? The thickness should be at least 14 pt or 0.014 inches so that all printing will appear uniform and legible. Make sure to choose heavyweight paper (at least 200-340 GSM) so your cards have a premium look and feel. The GSM (grams per square meter) is important since thicker cardstock is sturdier. Since business cards are carried around for a long time, they need to be able to handle rough treatment.

**Finish**

There are mainly two types of paper to print business cards at home. You can choose between [glossy and matte](https://medium.com/compandsave/glossy-vs-matte-photo-paper-which-is-better-500028110dfe) . If your card has a combination of different colors or graphics, go for a glossy finish, as this will make things pop. However, the matte finish is perfect for cards with primarily black text and graphics.

**Printing Type**

Are you going to print on just one side or both sides? Regular cardstock will work fine for the former, but for the latter, you need a special double-sided printing cardstock that's not see-through or has the ink bleeding through it.

**TIP:** If you want to go an extra mile on the fanciness meter, try exploring linen or textured cardstocks . Explore different kinds of paper for your printing projects.

### STEP 2: Deciding on Business Card Information Layout

When designing a business card, the first thing that needs to be done is to decide what information should be in it. Here are a few things to consider:

**Name**

This is an essential part of your card and should be in a large, easy-to-read font.

**Job Title**

Your business card is a way to introduce yourself to many people, so make sure to put what you do on it.

**Contact Info**

Include your business phone number and email address. Feel free to include the website URL of your brand as well.

**Social Media Links**

If you're active on social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook, consider including their handles at the bottom or at the back. You can also add QR codes for your social media handles at the back of your card.

**Personalization**

If you're looking to stand out from your coworkers or just have a unique card in general, consider adding a small headshot, a slogan, or even a quote from you when designing a business card..

### STEP 3: Designing a Business Card

Business cards made at home can look high-quality with suitable designs. Now you'll need to choose the elements for your business card printing. This includes fonts, colors, graphics, etc. Let's discuss them below.

**Decide on a Logo**

A good logo should be fairly easy to spot and recognize, look modern and elegant, and reflect your brand. If you don't have the resources or time to design a logo, consider getting help from a professional graphic designer.

**Pick a Color Scheme**

First, pick a color scheme that will be the dominant one on the cards. For example, you might go for a light blue as the base color, with different shades of purple or green used sparingly. Furthermore, you can go with bold colors or less saturated versions so that they'll look more natural on different printers. To help you decide, you can check out color palette generators, such as Canva business cards and Coolors. And lastly, consider using textures or patterns to add some extra visual interest.

**Choose a Font(s)**

Next, it's important to choose a font that is both legible and eye-catching. We recommend using a typeface such as Arial or Verdana, which are ideal for printing business card information.

**Graphics**

You can use photos, graphics files, or even handwritten notes for your cards. However, be sure to choose high-resolution files so that they'll print nicely without any errors.

**Layout**

Finally, decide on a layout for your cards. You can go with a classic design or something more creative and unique. Consider the overall look of your card—do you want it simple and minimalistic or flashy? The choice is yours!

**TIP:** Take inspiration from various business cards in your industry. Make sure to keep your card sleek and modern while still reflecting your brand. Lastly, ensure all the text on your cards is legible and easy enough for people to read at a distance.
