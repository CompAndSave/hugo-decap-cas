## Change Epson Ink Cartridge: Knowing What Ink it Uses

How do I change the cartridge in my Epson printer? Before knowing Epson printer ink change instructions, the first thing to do is find out which cartridge or ink bottle to buy. This step makes changing ink a breeze! To know what ink your Epson printer uses, try two easy methods: check the printer manual or look at the labels on your old ink cartridges. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Look in the Printer's Manual

The manual is like a guide for your printer. Find it in the box or online on the [Epson website](https://epson.com/usa). Inside, there's a part that tells you the exact ink your printer uses.

### 2. Check Old Ink Cartridges

If you have old ink in your printer, then take a look. Cartridges usually have labels showing the ink type or model. Write down the number on the cartridge; it'll be handy when picking up new ones.

Now that we've figured out which cartridge you will use, let’s now tackle the simple steps on how to change ink in Epson printer. This ensures your printer remains ready to bring your imagination to life with every page! Here are the steps you can follow:

**Step 1:** Make sure your printer is turned on. Lift the scanner bed to open up your printer. If you're setting up ink cartridges on a new printer, remove the placeholder plastic tabs before trying to install the ink cartridges.

**WARNING:** Don't move the printhead with your hands, as this might harm the printer. Also, avoid touching the flat white cable inside the printer to keep everything safe and working well.
