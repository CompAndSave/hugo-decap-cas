When the time comes to purchase a new Toner cartridge, there can be many avenues to take, so narrowing it down so you can find the exact cartridge, for both your printer and the task you need it for, is a task worth completing. 

There are certain guidelines that you should seek to follow and look for advice when you need it, as toner cartridges are not cheap, so making sure you choose the correct type at the first instance is important. You will always be able to find the correct toner cartridge for your type or model of printer; you just need to know the right places to look. You may notice that if you choose to purchase the original brand cartridges then you will be paying above the odds for the service.

There are many different routes you can take to find a cheaper alternative, one of the most common methods, is to use the compatible variant rather than the OEM cartridge. You can find compatible cartridges for all brands of printer including, HP, Cannon, Samsung, Brother and Apple. The best way I find to source your compatible ink cartridges is to search online. 

Searching for a [compatible ink](https://www.compandsave.com/) or toner cartridge online has never been easier, all you need is the knowledge of which type of cartridge you need for your printer. Many Internet sites will have search bars which will allow you to source your compatible ink cartridge easily and the purchase over the internet. By purchasing your ink cartridges using this method, you can save yourself countless hours of searching the local stores, only to find you still have no luck. 

The only downside to purchasing online is that you will obviously have to wait for delivery and this may take a few days. The shipping fee for delivery may be added to the total cost, however many retailers will offer a free delivery option, and you may also get extra discounts for purchasing two or more cartridges.

Compatible toner and ink cartridges are the best replacements for your old and used cartridges. When shopping for replacements online, you can find amazingly low prices on compatible cartridges through many online sources. The benefits of using compatible toner cartridges as opposed to OEM cartridges are endless. Make sure you get more for your money and purchase your toner cartridges the simplest method possible, through using your home internet connection.
