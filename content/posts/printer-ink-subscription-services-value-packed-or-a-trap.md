## **Ink Cartridge Subscription: What Does It Mean?**

A printer ink subscription is a service that automatically delivers ink to your door when your printer detects it’s running low. Instead of buying new cartridges each time, you pay a monthly fee based on your typical printing volume. This can save time and effort, especially for frequent users or busy households.

Some of the most well-known printer ink subscription services include HP Instant Ink, Canon PIXMA Print Plan, Brother Refresh EZ Print Subscription, and Epson ReadyPrint. Each one has its own pricing model, supported printers, and refill process, so it's essential to weigh your options.

That brings us to the next big question: ***Are they worth it?***

Let’s take a closer look at how these top ink subscription plans stack up—what they offer, what they cost, and who they’re best suited for.

## **Printer Ink Subscription Services Compared: Value-Packed or Just a Trap?**

With so many brands offering monthly ink plans, it’s easy to assume they’re a great deal—but are they really? Let’s break down what each printer ink subscription service offers, so you can decide if it’s a smart way to save or just another recurring cost to manage.

### **1. HP Instant Ink Subscription**

One of the most popular options, the HP Instant Ink subscription takes the hassle out of buying ink by tracking your printer’s ink levels and automatically sending new cartridges before you run out. Instead of paying for ink by the cartridge, you pay a monthly fee based on how many pages you expect to print. Plans start at just $1.79 per month for 10 pages and include everything—ink, shipping, and even recycling of used cartridges. It’s a convenient option for home users and small businesses who want to avoid surprise ink runs.

Below are the available HP Instant Ink plans:

#### **Pros of HP Instant Ink**

* **Automatic delivery**

Ink is shipped directly to your door, so you never have to worry about last-minute trips to the store.

* **Pricing is based on pages, not how much ink you use**

Whether you print text or full-color photos, each page counts the same. This is great if you print a lot of color pages.

* **Unused pages roll over to the next month**

If you don’t use all your pages, they’re saved (up to a limit) and can be used later, so you don’t lose what you paid for.

#### **Cons of HP Instant Ink**

* **Works only with [eligible HP printers](https://www.hp.com/us-en/printers/instant-ink/printer-compatibility.html#modal=modal-eligible-printers)**

Not all HP printers are compatible with Instant Ink. You’ll need a compatible model that supports this subscription service.

* **Ink is locked to subscription use only**

The ink cartridges sent through Instant Ink only work while your subscription is active. If you cancel, they stop working—even if they’re full.

* **Doesn’t support third-party ink**

If your printer is enrolled in HP+, it will reject cheaper third-party ink, even if you cancel your Instant Ink subscription.

* **Internet connection is required**

Your printer must stay connected to the internet so HP can track your ink levels and page count. Without it, the service won’t work properly.

#### **So, are HP Instant Ink plans really worth it?**

To give you a clearer picture of whether an ink cartridge subscription is worth it, here’s what some real subscribers have shared on a [Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hewlett_Packard/comments/1kxxoni/hp_instant_ink_subscription_worth_it_or_not/) about their experience with the service:

### **2. Canon PIXMA Print Plan**

Canon’s PIXMA Print Plan provides a convenient and smart way to manage ink for eligible PIXMA printers. Similar to HP’s subscription, it monitors your ink levels and automatically sends replacement cartridges before you run out. 

If you print only occasionally, you can go with the Pay Per Print option at $0.20 per page, with no monthly fee. High-volume users can opt for the Frequent Plan at $10.99/month, which includes 200 pages. All monthly plans include ink delivery and allow unused pages to roll over to the next month, up to your plan’s limit.
