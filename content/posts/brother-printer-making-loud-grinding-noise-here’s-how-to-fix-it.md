## **Understanding the Noises: Brother Printer Making Loud Grinding Noise vs. Clicking**

A Brother printer making a loud grinding noise or a clicking sound often points to issues with gears, rollers, or toner alignment. Before you replace toner in a Brother printer, it's important to understand what each noise means so you can fix it quickly.

### **A. What a Grinding Noise Means**

A Brother printer grinding noise is deep and constant. It often happens during startup or while printing.

**Common causes:**

* Worn or broken gears
* Dry or unlubricated components
* Paper jammed or loaded incorrectly
* Misaligned parts after you [replace drum on Brother printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-replace-drum-on-brother-printer-a-step-by-step-guide.html)

### **B. What a Clicking Noise Means**

A Brother printer clicking noise is sharp and comes in short bursts. It may happen during startup or when a page begins to print.

**Likely causes:**

* Toner not installed properly
* Slipping clutch or roller issue
* Misfeed after resetting the toner on the Brother printer

## **Most Common Reasons for Brother Printer Clicking Noises**

A Brother printer making loud grinding noise usually means internal hardware issues. Common causes include worn gears, misaligned rollers, or debris. Check these before you replace a toner in Brother printer or call support.

### **1. Gear Damage or Misalignment**

One of the main causes of a Brother printer grinding noise is worn or misaligned gears. These plastic gears manage paper movement and toner rotation. If broken, they make harsh grinding sounds.

**How to spot it:**

* Printer sounds rough during printing
* Grinding starts immediately when powering on
* You may see plastic shavings or fragments near the toner area

### **2. Paper Feed and Pickup Issues**

A Brother printer making a loud clicking noise may point to paper feed errors. Misfed paper or roller misalignment can confuse the printer, causing gears to misfire.

**What to check:**

* Remove the rear tray and look for stuck paper
* Make sure the paper isn't curled, torn, or damp
* Confirm the tray is loaded correctly, with the guides tight but not bent

### **3. Foreign Objects or Debris Inside the Printer**

If something is stuck inside, like paper pieces, clips, or dust, it can block the rollers and lead to a Brother printer clicking noise. This is especially common in shared office printers.

**How to check:**

* Power off and unplug
* Remove the toner and drum
* Use a flashlight to inspect corners and paths
* Gently remove any visible debris

### **4. Faulty or Improperly Installed Toner/Drum Units**

A misaligned toner or drum can create a Brother printer making loud grinding noise right after startup. Low quality third-party toner can also cause issues if it's not built to an exact fit.

**Fix this by:**

* Removing and reinstalling both units securely
* Avoiding off-brand cartridges if possible
* Try [resetting toner on Brother printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/resetting-toner-on-brother-printer-the-fast-fix-that-works.html) if the noise started after the replacement

### **5. Lack of Lubrication in Moving Parts**

Gears and rollers can dry out over time, especially in warm or dusty environments. This leads to friction and a grinding sound during use.

**Solution:**

* Use printer-safe lubricant sparingly on gear areas.
* Never spray directly. Apply to a cloth or swab first.
* If unsure, skip this and contact Brother support.

## **Step-by-Step Guide: How to Fix Brother Printer Making Grinding or Clicking Noises**

Based on Brother’s support data and user reports, a few simple steps, no tools needed, can often solve the problem.

* Look for loose pieces or uneven parts

* Don’t over-lubricate

Stopping a Brother printer from making clicking sounds before it starts saves time and repair costs. Maintenance doesn’t need to be technical, just regular care.

* Clean around the drum and toner housing
* Use a lint-free cloth, not compressed air

* In a dry, cool place
* On a stable desk or stand
* Covered when not in use
