## What Are OEM Cartridges: Knowing the Difference Between Remanufactured Cartridges

[Remanufactured cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/what-are-remanufactured-ink-cartridges-guide) and OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) cartridges are two different types of printer ink or toner options. OEM cartridges are brand-new cartridges manufactured by the same company that makes your printer. 

For example, if you have an HP printer, then the OEM cartridge would originate from HP as well. While they are known for guaranteed compatibility and quality, they often [come at a higher price](https://www.compandsave.com/why-printer-ink-is-so-expensive-guide).

## Remanufactured Printer Cartridges: How Are They Made?

Now, let's talk about remanufactured cartridges. Remanufactured cartridges are recycled, previously used cartridges that undergo a thorough cleaning and refurbishing process to ensure they meet quality standards. Let’s take a look at each one:

**Step 1: Collection of Used Cartridges**

The remanufacturing process begins with the collection of used printer cartridges. These cartridges are sourced from various channels, including [recycling programs and returns](https://www.compandsave.com/where-to-recycle-ink-cartridges-guide).

**Step 2: Disassembly**

These used cartridges are carefully disassembled.

**Step 3: Inspecting**

After components are disassembled, each cartridge piece is checked to see if anything is broken or not working. 

**Step 4: Cleaning**

After that, all components go through a meticulous cleaning process. This involves removing any remaining ink residue and ensuring that each part is free from contaminants.

**Step 5: Reassembling** 

If any components are found to be faulty or not working well, either the parts are repaired or replaced with functional ones. After that, all the pieces are put back together the right way.

**Step 6: Adding Ink**

The cleaned and repaired cartridges are then refilled with high-quality ink. This ink is carefully selected to meet or exceed the specifications of the original equipment manufacturer (OEM).

**Step 7: Quality Check**

These cartridges are double-checked to make sure they work well and are of good quality.

This eco-friendly approach not only reduces waste but also offers a cost-effective alternative without compromising on print quality. Basically, it's like giving used cartridges a second chance and helping out the environment at the same time! 

## Remanufactured Cartridges: Why Choose This?

### 2. Quality Assurance

Look for cartridges that undergo rigorous testing and quality checks. Good companies will tell you how they test their cartridges to ensure they are as good as they should be. This information is important because it shows that the company cares about making sure their remanufactured cartridges meet the standards everyone expects. So, when you're buying, check for details about how the cartridges are tested to make sure they're really good.
