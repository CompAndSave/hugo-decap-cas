## **Printers Compatible with Mac: Why Does It Matter?**

![mac](/blog/images/mac.png "mac")

A Mac—short for Macintosh—is Apple’s line of personal computers running the macOS operating system. This includes the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Mini. Known for their sleek design and seamless user experience, Macs can still face challenges when connecting to certain printers.

Unlike Windows PCs, macOS uses its own drivers and software architecture, which means not all printers are fully compatible. Choosing a Mac printer ensures smoother setup, reliable performance, and access to features like AirPrint, wireless connectivity, and mobile printing, without the need for extra software or workarounds.

## **Tips for Choosing the Right Printer for Your Mac**

Not all printers are compatible with Apple devices, so selecting the right one means fewer headaches and improved performance. Here are 6 important tips to help you find the best printer for Mac:

### **1. Make sure it works with macOS**

Before purchasing, verify that the printer is compatible with macOS. Some models only offer full features for Windows. A printer that’s officially compatible with Mac will be easier to set up and more reliable in the long run. Look for macOS drivers or confirmation on the manufacturer’s website.

### **2. Choose one with AirPrint**

AirPrint is Apple’s built-in printing system. If it’s an [AirPrint-enabled printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/what-is-an-airprint-enabled-printer-features-top-picks.html), you don’t need to install any software or drivers. You can print directly from your Mac, iPhone, or iPad over Wi-Fi. It’s the easiest way to ensure seamless printing across all your Apple devices.

### **3. Know what you’ll print most**

Your printing habits matter.

* If you mostly print text documents, go for a laser printer—it’s faster and gives sharp results.
* If you need to print color documents, school projects, or photos, an inkjet printer is a better option.
* For light use, a basic model will do. For regular or business use, opt for a model with a higher page capacity and additional features.

### **4. Don’t forget about ink or toner cost**

Some printers are cheap upfront but come with pricey ink or toner refills. Over time, that adds up. Instead, look for printers that support refillable tanks or third-party ink like what [CompAndSave](http://compandsave.com) offers. This way, you lower your total printing cost without sacrificing quality.

### **5. Check wireless and connection options**

A wireless printer for Mac lets you print from anywhere in the house—no cords needed. Make sure the printer supports Wi-Fi and AirPrint. Some also offer Ethernet for a more stable network connection or USB if you prefer a wired setup. The more connection options, the better.

### **6. Look at extra features**

If you print or scan often, extra features can save you time and effort. These features may cost a bit more, but they make your printing setup much more efficient.

* Auto 2-sided printing helps save paper.
* Scanning and copying features are useful for school, work, or documents.
* An automatic document feeder (ADF) is ideal if you frequently scan multi-page documents.

## **Best Printer for Mac in 2025: Inkjet and Laser Top Picks**

We’ve listed the top models for both inkjet and laser printers that are simple to set up, support wireless printing, and help you save on ink or toner. Whether you're printing documents or photos, these options are ideal for both home and office use.
