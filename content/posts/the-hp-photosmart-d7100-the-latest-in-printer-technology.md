In this article we are going to look at the PhotoSmart D7100 printer, which is one of the latest printers to have been released from HP. We are looking to find printer which will suite our individual needs, weather this the printer is to be used in the family home or in the workplace is just one of the factors which may influence our final decision. The truth is that many people do not actually know which printer will be the best for them, and many of us are tricked into believing that the printer which boasts the highest price is probably the best, this is not the case.

There are so many printers out there on the market today, that t can be very hard to choose the best printer for you. One of these printers is the PhotoSmart D7100 printer, which has been made available to purchase from the well-known printing brand Hewlett Packard. HP has long been found to release only the best products with the latest printing technology integrated into their items. So just how does the HP PhotoSmart D7100 printer stack up to the rest of the competition?

In truth upon the initial look the printer appears to be quite basic, however do not judge a book by its cover, as upon a further investigation we find that this printer is very capable indeed. Unlike other more modern printers of the PhotoSmart series, this printer does not have a wireless capability or even an LCD screen of which was highly popular with the other models in the series, however this does not mean that the printer is inferior to the others, as it can still produce amazing results for you when it is used. It still uses the familiar six ink colour ink design and will be able to produce a fantastic quality of image when it is used. It is a dedicated image or picture printer like other printers within the series. 

The PhotoSmart D7100 printer is still quite easy to use, despite the lack of an LCD screen; there are several buttons on the outer casing of the printer which will enable you to make the choice of how you wish the printer to work for you. All in all this printer is more than capable to be used within the family home or small office space in which you require it, it will print quick and also in high detail for you, and much like the other PhotoSmart printers, it is both durable and reliable to be used for several years.

[PhotoSmart D7100 ink](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/photosmart/d7100-ink-cartridges) can be found to purchase from a variety of locations, however it is advised that you look to use compatible ink cartridges, as opposed to the more expensively priced genuine types, as this will help you to gain the most from your printer, whilst cutting the running costs down of your printer.
