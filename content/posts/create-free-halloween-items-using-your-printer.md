If you have an inkjet printer, there are several fun, inexpensive ways to spice up your Halloween this year. You can craft tattoos, signs, and more using your printer and just a few extras.

## Create Halloween Tattoos

Have you ever tried using your printer to create Halloween tattoos? Temporary tattoos are easy to make with your printer. You just need an inkjet printer, color or black [ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/), decal paper, and downloadable clip art.

Martha Stewart offers an easy, do-it-yourself ink project for creepy spiders. The site gives you step-by-step instructions on downloading, printing, and cutting the spider tattoos.

Don't want to see spiders up and down your arms? No problem—you can use the same method to create temporary tattoos for any type of art you want.

What to do when Halloween is over? Usually, you can easily peel off temporary tattoos. If they don't come off smoothly at first, try rubbing a little baby oil on top and then they should slide off.

## Make Halloween Décor

You might like chalkboard printables if you're into shabby chic or want a homespun feel for your Halloween party. These Halloween printables from [Classy Clutter](https://www.classyclutter.net/free-halloween-chalkboard-printables/) are free and can be downloaded simply by right clicking the image and saving to your computer. Then you can print using regular printer paper. Or take it up a notch and use specialty paper, such as [canvas paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/canvas) or [textured photo paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/textured). Even decorate your fridge with some Halloween décor using [magnet sheets](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/magnet-sheets).

You can't have a proper Halloween without pumpkins and jack-o'-lanterns. [The Balance](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/free-pumpkin-carving-patterns-and-templates-1357644) compiled an extensive list of free pumpkin carving patterns. Carve an intricate haunted house, go political with a donkey and elephant, or be traditional with a silly face. For most designs, simply download, print, and trace on to your pumpkin.

## Entertain with Halloween Games

Halloween scattergories is a simple, cost-effective game to liven up your children's Halloween party. The [Crafting Chicks](https://thecraftingchicks.com/halloween-scattergories/) came up with this printable to write down Halloween-related words in a set amount of time. Give it a try at your Halloween party. The game can easily be adapted for adults too.
