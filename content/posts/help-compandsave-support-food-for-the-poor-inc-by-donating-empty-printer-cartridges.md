"Last year, over 400,000 tons of ink and toner cartridges ended up in landfills. They can actually sit there for over 1,000 years, but no one, not even scientists know how long it takes for plastic to fully biodegrade because it's never been seen, " said Andrew Yeung, President of CompAndSave.com. "We've been planning for some time to address this issue and have finally found the ideal solution with Food for the Poor â€“ the Non-Profit Organization."

[CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com) is we collecting empty ink and toner cartridges by asking their shoppers and visitors to mail cartridge donations to their headquarters in Newark, California. From there, they will send them to GreenHippo.com, an e-waste recycling company located in LA, CA, where the printer cartridges will be recycled and CompAndSave will be reimbursed. They have pledged to donate 100% of these proceeds to Food for the Poor Non-Profit Organization and have a dedicated [Champions Page](https://foodforthepoor.org)for direct donations.

"We are not seeking any profit, this isn't our goal", said by Andrew Yeung, President of CompAndSave.com, "Our only aim is to lower the amount of e-waste in landfills and provide meals to those in need." CompAndSave will be devoting resources to support Food for the Poor with their printer cartridge recycling program through a variety of channels. They have chosen the campaign slogan, "You Can Help the Hungry, One Cartridge at a Time"; to highlight that even one empty cartridge contribution makes a difference to feed one child at a less than $0.13 a day for a total of $48.50 a year. CompAndSave plans to help feed as many hungry children as possible with their recycling program.

The [fundraising goal](https://www.compandsave.com)of CompAndSave is to collect 10,000 cartridges by this time next year, and the company is encouraging everyone to help them reach it. Donated empty ink and toner cartridges can be mailed to the address below at donators' own expense for shipping:
