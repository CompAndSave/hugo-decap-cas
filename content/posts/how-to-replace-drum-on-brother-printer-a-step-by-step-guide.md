## What Is A Drum: Understanding the Drum's Role

[![drum in laser printer](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-10-18-at-6.21.32 pm.png "drum in laser printer")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-10-18-at-6.21.32 pm.png)

The drum in a laser printer is usually green. This green part is made of a special material that can hold an electric charge. When you print something, the drum gets charged and attracts toner. As the paper moves through the printer, the toner sticks to the drum and then gets pressed onto the paper to create images or text. 

In color laser printers, there are often several drums—one for each color: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black. However, they typically still have that green coating.

Brother laser printers come in various shapes and sizes; most have separate toner and drum units. [Brother](https://www.brother.co.uk/support/answers/difference-between-toner-cartridge-and-drum) explains that this design is essential for a good reason. With Brother printers, you buy the drum and toner cartridges separately. While it might seem easier and cheaper to combine them, it can cost you more in the long run. 

Toner cartridges usually run out before the drum, often needing three or four replacements of toner before you need to change drum in Brother printer. This means you can replace each part separately when needed, so you don’t have to pay for a new drum that still works whenever you need a new toner.

## Brother Printer Drum Replacement: Signs When To Do This

Over time, the drum in your Brother printer can wear out, leading to lower print quality, such as faded or streaky pages. While some printers may keep working after the "replace drum" warning appears, it's a good idea to have a spare drum ready just in case. Drum units usually last for about three toner changes.

**Here’s a tip:** You can help extend the life of your drum by cleaning the corona wire every so often. To do this, slide the small green plastic tab attached to the corona wire back and forth a few times, as shown in the picture below:

### To know if your drum needs replacing, watch for these signs:

* **Image Quality Declines:** If your prints are not as sharp or clear, even after changing the toner, it could mean the drum needs replacing.
* **Printer Notification:** Pay attention to your printer’s messages. If you see a "replace drum" light or message, it’s best to follow that warning and replace the drum.
* **Squeaky Noises:** If your printer starts making squeaky sounds while it’s working, it might mean the drum or fuser is worn out. This noise happens when damaged parts rub against each other, causing the squeak.

### Other Tips:

You can also check if you need to replace drum on printer with this simple guideline:

**1 Drum Unit Yield = 15,000 pages (assuming 1 page per job).**

However, if you reach the 15,000-page mark and your prints still look good, you can keep using the drum if you don’t see any problems. Once you notice issues with print quality, it’s time to think about replacing your Brother drum.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. What is the purpose of the drum in a laser printer?

The drum in a laser printer plays a vital role in the printing process. It gets charged with electricity and uses a laser to create an image on its surface. This image attracts toner powder, which sticks to the charged areas of the drum. As the drum rolls, it transfers the toner onto paper, creating the final print. Finally, heat from the printer melts the toner to bond it to the paper permanently.

### 2. How long does a drum unit typically last in a Brother printer?

The drum unit in a Brother printer usually lasts between 12,000 and 15,000 pages. However, this can change based on your printer model, how much you print, and other factors. It's important to note that the drum typically needs to be replaced after using about 3 to 4 toner cartridges. If you print a lot, you might need to replace the drum more often. 

### 3. How do I manually clean my printer drum?

To manually clean your printer drum, follow these steps:

Step 1: Turn off the printer and unplug it

Step 2: Open the printer’s front cover of the printer and remove the toner cartridge and drum unit carefully

Step 3: Use a soft, dry, lint-free cloth to gently wipe any visible dust or debris from the surface of the drum.

Step 4: If necessary, use a bit of rubbing alcohol applied to a clean cloth to clean stubborn stains or marks gently.
