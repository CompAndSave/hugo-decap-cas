A new school year can be exciting! At the same time, it can be challenging and a little intimidating for both students and teachers. One of the ways to ease the back to school process is with good organization and a well-thought out plan. Here are some printable ideas that will help students and teachers for a stress free school year!

### Must-Have Printables for Students 

From timesheet tables to healthy lunch recipes, here are some ideas on helpful printables.

**Book Labels & More**

Customize book labels with a cartoon character of choice (or even kid's own photo)! You could also print out labels for book shelves, boxes, toy crates, wardrobes, etc.. This encourages kids to put away stuff in a more organized manner and find it more easily when required**.**
