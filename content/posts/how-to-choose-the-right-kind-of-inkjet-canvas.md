**How to Choose the Right Kind of Inkjet Canvas**

When it comes to choosing the right kind of inkjet canvas, it is very necessary to analyze your printing needs. In addition to this, you must know the difference between the quality usage and benefits of both types of inject canvas. A cotton inkjet canvas is a traditional canvas which is made out of 100 percent cotton. Most traditional artists prefer using this type of canvas for their paintings in order to bring a natural factor in their work. It is a genuine cotton canvas without any lamination, whereas a polyester canvas is a satin-finish inkjet canvas that is shiny. This type of canvas also has cotton-like structure, but the difference is that it comes with a satin layer. This may be called as modern printing canvas.

As mentioned earlier, cotton inkjet canvas is mostly used by traditional painters, whereas all contemporary painters prefer polyester inkjet canvas. The reason being, a polyester canvas is extremely flexible and there are no risks of cracking of the artwork. The print remains absolutely smooth even after rolling the canvas. It is ideal for stretching over and around bars. Lamination of cotton inkjet canvas is required to ensure the longevity of the picture or portrait, whereas it is not required in polyester canvas due to its satin layer. Those artists who hate getting their artwork laminated, thinking it as a time-consuming process, rely upon the contemporary canvas. Of course, it has its own benefits over traditional cotton canvas. The advantage of using the genuine cotton canvas is that the portrait looks 100 percent natural and authentic, but it may get cracked on rolling the canvas. 

Users should keep in mind their own unique requirements before choosing the right inkjet canvas for them. Both of them are available at economical prices. The basic idea is to fulfill your requirements. Apart from this, the quality of photo printing also depends upon the type of ink chosen. Always use a good quality product. Make a thorough research about the products available in the market and find the one that suits your job best.
