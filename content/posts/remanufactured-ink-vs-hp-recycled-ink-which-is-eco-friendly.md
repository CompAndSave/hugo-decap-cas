## Ink Cartridges: How It Impacts The Environment?

Many of us use printers for various tasks, whether at home printing family photos or at work for essential documents. This means we rely on ink cartridges to keep our printers running. 

The problem is that regular ink cartridges, usually made of plastic and metal, harm the environment. Not just that! Making new cartridges adds to carbon emissions and uses up natural resources. Also, throwing out old cartridges adds to a big problem called electronic waste, which can be harmful if not handled properly. 

To address this issue, companies like HP recycle ink cartridges to create new ones, and there are also third-party companies that remanufacture these used cartridges. The question is, which option is the best one? Letâ€™s find out below!

## Remanufactured Ink Cartridge vs. Recycled Ones: Which Is Better?

Consumers typically consider the advantages and disadvantages of remanufactured and recycled ink cartridges before choosing. Remanufactured cartridges have been [professionally refurbished and refilled with ink](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/remanufactured-printer-cartridges-how-are-they-made.html), offering a cost-effective alternative to brand-new cartridges. 

On the other hand, recycled cartridges, such as those produced by HP, are made using the components gathered from used cartridges mailed from the United States, Canada, and Mexico or that are dropped off at retailers like Walmart or Staples. These materials are then processed to create new cartridges. According to HP's Chief Sustainability Officer, James McCall, the company [crushes and recycles approximately 100,000 cartridges daily](https://www.rtmworld.com/news/hp-boasts-crushing-100k-cartridges-a-day/) as part of this initiative. 

Both remanufacturing and printer cartridge recycling help the environment, but they have some differences, too. Here's a comparison to understand them better:
