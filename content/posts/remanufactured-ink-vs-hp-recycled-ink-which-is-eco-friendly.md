## Ink Cartridges: How It Impacts The Environment?

Many of us use printers for various tasks, whether at home printing family photos or at work for essential documents. This means we rely on ink cartridges to keep our printers running.

The problem is that regular ink cartridges, usually made of plastic and metal, harm the environment. Not just that! Making new cartridges adds to carbon emissions and uses up natural resources. Also, throwing out old cartridges adds to a big problem called electronic waste, which can be harmful if not handled properly.

To address this issue, companies like HP recycle ink cartridges to create new ones, and there are also third-party companies that remanufacture these used cartridges. The question is, which option is the best one? Let’s find out below!

## Remanufactured Ink Cartridge vs. Recycled Ones: Which Is Better?

Consumers typically consider the advantages and disadvantages of remanufactured and recycled ink cartridges before choosing. Remanufactured cartridges have been [professionally refurbished and refilled with ink](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/remanufactured-printer-cartridges-how-are-they-made.html), offering a cost-effective alternative to brand-new cartridges.

On the other hand, recycled cartridges, such as those produced by HP, are made using the components gathered from used cartridges mailed from the United States, Canada, and Mexico or that are dropped off at retailers like Walmart or Staples. These materials are then processed to create new cartridges. According to HP's Chief Sustainability Officer, James McCall, the company crushes and recycles approximately 100,000 cartridges daily as part of this initiative.

Both remanufacturing and printer cartridge recycling help the environment, but they have some differences, too. Here's a comparison to understand them better:

### Remanufactured Cartridges

Remanufacturing means reusing the original cartridge instead of throwing it away. Cartridges that have been used once are collected to be remanufactured. Then, they undergo a refurbishing process that includes inspection, cleaning, replacing worn-out parts, and refilling each cartridge with quality ink. After that, they undergo rigorous testing to ensure they [work like the original](https://www.compandsave.com/are-remanufactured-ink-cartridges-good-guide) and meet performance and reliability standards.

This method promotes sustainability by reducing waste through reusing ink cartridges. This helps prevent the environmental harm caused by crushing and melting cartridges, which releases harmful smoke and plastic fumes into the air, as highlighted by [SAS](https://www.sentryair.com/plastic-fumes.htm#:~:text=In%20general%20inhalation%20of%20plastic,%2C%20liver%2C%20and%20reproductive%20system.). Not only this can worsen air pollution, but also contributes to global warming. Additionally, when humans inhale these fumes, it can lead to health issues like cancer or reproductive problems.

Using remanufactured cartridges not only benefits the environment but also saves you money! These cartridges are often more affordable than OEM ones, allowing you to save on printing costs without compromising quality. So, it's a win-win for both your wallet and the planet.

### Recycled Cartridges

Opposed to remanufacturing, HP uses recycling to make new cartridges by crushing 100,000 cartridges each day. Used cartridges are sorted and disassembled, and the [plastic is shredded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6yXF8q6HU8) for reuse. This can reduce the need for new plastic materials, but the process still involves melting plastic cartridges together with other plastics (bottles and hangers) and turning them into pellets. This process alone requires a lot of energy, from sorting to shredding to melting. Additionally, when companies recycle printer ink cartridges, not all parts of it can be used, which means some waste still ends up in landfills.

After being crushed, the cartridges are sent to processing plants to be turned into new ones. A single toner cartridge releases about 4.8kg of CO2 greenhouse gases. CO2, or carbon dioxide, is a gas that traps heat in our atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change. This gas adds to the greenhouse effect, making temperatures rise, ice melt, and weather more extreme. So, 4.8kg of CO2 from one cartridge manufacturing contributes to environmental problems and worsens climate change. How about 100,000 cartridges from processing plants? Additionally, valuable resources like metal, crude oil, and natural gas are used in this process.

Even if some parts are recycled, the cost of recycled cartridges is typically the same as that of new ones due to the extensive process involved in creating new cartridges, including the internal components. This is due to the fact that producing cartridges is costly and requires a lot of work and expensive materials.

### So, Which Is More Eco-Friendly?

When we compare remanufactured ink cartridges with recycled ones, we must consider the whole process. Recycling cartridges does reduce the need for new materials, like HP's use of 50% recycled plastics. However, remanufacturing is even more environmentally friendly!

**Here are the key takeaways:**

* Extended Lifespan: Remanufactured cartridges reuse original parts, reducing the need for new materials. In contrast, recycled cartridges require new parts like printheads and electronic pieces, which increases the use of resources.
* Energy Consumption: Remanufacturing cartridges uses less energy and fewer resources compared to recycling. It involves fewer steps and transportation needs, making it a more sustainable option. Manufacturing new parts consumes energy, mainly from fossil fuels, leading to greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and climate change.
* Waste Generation: The production of new parts generates waste, including leftovers from making them, packaging materials, and thrown-out or old pieces. If we don't get rid of this waste properly, it can harm the environment and our health.
* Environmental Impact: Melting plastic and making new parts creates pollution, damages habitats, and harms wildlife. These effects can be serious and spread far, affecting ecosystems and communities.
* Price Comparison: Remanufactured cartridges are much cheaper than brand-new ones, sometimes even sold at 80% off the original price, while HP's recycled cartridges usually cost about the same as brand-new ones.

As you can see, there are many benefits to using remanufactured printer cartridges. So, if we want to be greener when printing, choosing remanufactured cartridges is a wiser choice. Give them a shot if you haven't already—they could save you money and work just as well as new ones.
