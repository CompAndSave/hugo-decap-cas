![Brother Printer Firmware Update](/blog/images/brother-printer-firmware.png "How Brother Printer Firmware Update Affects Non-OEM Cartridges")

One small update can turn your reliable Brother printer into a frustrating paperweight. This is the reality many users face after installing a recent Brother printer firmware update, especially those using third-party ink or toner.

Instead of improved performance, the result is often cartridge errors, print failures, or the printer refusing to work entirely. While firmware updates on Brother printers are meant to fix bugs, improve security, and ensure better compatibility, they can sometimes introduce unexpected restrictions or changes that affect printer performance or cartridge use. The biggest concern? Blocking non-OEM cartridges without warning leads to unnecessary costs and downtime. That’s why many users end up searching for [Brother printer troubleshooting](https://www.compandsave.com/brother-printer-troubleshooting-guide) guides after an update.

**In this guide, you'll discover:**

* What does a Firmware update Brother printer do?
* Pros and cons of updating, especially for third-party cartridge users
* How Firmware affects non-OEM ink and toner
* Safe ways to update Brother Firmware

## **What Is a Brother Printer Firmware Update?**

Facing a Brother printer issue? Before blaming drivers, check the firmware, the internal software that controls your printer’s functions. Brother printer firmware update changes how your printer operates, including how it detects ink and toner. Firmware isn’t the same as a driver. Drivers sit on your computer. Firmware lives inside the printer, managing tasks like:

* Cartridge recognition
* Print protocols
* Paper handling
* Security settings

When you update the firmware of your Brother printer, this changes core behaviours, which can cause issues with third-party cartridges.

### **What Brother Firmware Controls**

Brother’s device firmware and embedded controls affect:

* Ink and toner validation
* Duplex printing and scanning
* Network and print settings

### **Should You Update Firmware on a Brother Printer?**

If your printer works fine, skip updates, especially if using third-party ink. But if you face repeated errors or need security fixes, you may want to update the Brother firmware.

Always weigh the pros and cons before you [upgrade printer firmware](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/should-you-upgrade-printer-firmware-read-before-you-regret.html). An update could fix Brother printer offline issues or block your current cartridges.

## **Why Brother Firmware Updates Matter**

A Brother printer firmware update improves security, fixes bugs, and ensures compatibility. But it can also cause a Brother printer issue by blocking third-party cartridges, a common reason users search for printer troubleshooting.

### **1. Security Fixes**

With every firmware update, Brother releases patches for known vulnerabilities. This prevents unauthorized access, protects your data, and secures network-connected printers.

### **2. Bug Fixes and Stability**

If your device freezes, disconnects, or prints slowly, updating Brother firmware may fix it. Brother regularly releases firmware to solve system errors and improve performance.

### **3. OS and App Compatibility**

The firmware update Brother printer keeps your device compatible with Windows, macOS, mobile apps, and new drivers. Without it, your printer may stop responding after system updates.

### **4. Cartridge Restrictions**

Many updates block non-OEM ink and toner. After updating the firmware on the Brother printer, users often report cartridge errors. If you use third-party supplies, updating may disable them.

## **Should You Update Brother Printer Firmware? (Pros & Cons Breakdown)**

Before you install a Brother printer firmware update, consider both its benefits and downsides. While updates often fix bugs and improve performance, many users experience issues afterward, especially those using third-party cartridges. Let’s break down the pros and cons.

### **Pros of Updating Brother Firmware**

* **Improved Security:** A firmware update Brother printer can patch known security flaws. This protects your device from unauthorized access or malware.
* **Better Performance:** Updates often solve lag, print errors, and other [Brother printer issues](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/brother-printer-issue-is-ink-lockdown-making-them-the-next-hp.html). They help stabilize the system and ensure smoother performance.
* **New Features & OS Compatibility:** If you're upgrading your computer, you'll likely need to update firmware on your Brother printer for compatibility with the latest software and drivers.

### **Cons of Update Firmware Brother Printer**

* **Loss of Third-Party Compatibility:** One significant drawback is the risk of updates blocking third-party ink or toner. This affects users who are trying to cut costs with non-OEM options.
* **Failed Updates & Errors:** Some users face update failures that make the device unstable or completely unusable. In such cases, even trying to fix issues won’t work until a rollback is done, which is often unsupported.
* **No Easy Rollback:** Once you update Brother firmware, going back isn’t simple. Most Brother printers don't support rollback, so you’re stuck with the update even if it causes issues.


## **How Can a Firmware Update Affect the Use of Third-Party Cartridges?**

Brother printer firmware update files are often released to enhance security, fix software bugs, or support new system features. But for users relying on non-OEM (third-party) ink or toner, these updates can trigger major problems.

### **1. Cartridge Detection Failure**

After a firmware update of the Brother printer, the printer may no longer recognize third-party cartridges. This is because the firmware includes new validation checks that reject non-genuine chip data. As a result, even full and functional cartridges may show as “empty,” “incompatible,” or trigger a Brother printer issue message.

### **2. Printing is Blocked Entirely**

In some cases, printers stop functioning together after an update. Users have reported that their machines refuse to print unless genuine Brother cartridges are installed. This issue can feel like the printer is “bricked,” especially if there’s no way to roll back or fix issues caused by locked cartridges.

### **3. Unexpected Error Messages**

A sudden Brother printer firmware update can cause a spike in error codes. Some users experience new warnings or alerts tied directly to ink system compatibility. These errors are hard to bypass and often require Brother printer troubleshooting or complete cartridge replacement.

### **4. No Option to Roll Back Firmware**

Once you update firmware on Brother printer, reverting isn’t always possible. Brother rarely supports firmware downgrades, leaving users stuck with blocked cartridges and limited support, especially if they’ve used third-party supplies not covered by warranty.

### **5. Financial Impact**

Being forced to buy OEM cartridges due to firmware changes can quickly increase printing costs. This contradicts the very reason many users choose compatible alternatives. It also complicates basic efforts to upgrade printer firmware while staying budget-conscious.


**Steps to Safely Perform a Firmware Update Brother Printer** 

Many users perform a Brother printer firmware update to improve performance or resolve a Brother printer issue. However, updating without caution can lead to problems, especially if you use third-party cartridges. Follow these simple steps to reduce risks and avoid Brother printer troubleshooting later.

### **Before You Update Firmware on Brother Printer**

* **Check Printer Model & Current Firmware:** Visit the printer’s control panel or settings menu to check its model and firmware version. Make sure you only download the right version for your specific device.
* **Back Up Settings:** Save current settings in case you need to restore them after the update.
* **Use Up Third-Party Cartridges:** Before updating the firmware on your Brother printer, finish any third-party ink or toner. Updates may block them afterward.

### **How to Use the Brother Firmware Update Tool**

* **Download the Tool:** Get the Brother Firmware Update Tool from the official Brother support site, [support.brother.com](https://support.brother.com/). Only download from trusted sources.
* **Install and Launch:** Install the tool on your computer. Open it, then follow the on-screen instructions to update the firmware on the Brother printer.
* **Connect Your Printer:** Use a USB or network connection. Avoid Wi-Fi for more reliable updates.

### **Follow the Firmware Update Process**

* **Accept Prompts and Warnings:** Read and agree to the EULA and prompts. These outline what the update will do.
* **Don’t Power Off:** Never shut down the printer mid-process. Interrupting the update can brick the device or cause a printer issue.
* **Confirm Update:** After the tool finishes, it will confirm success. Check the firmware version again to ensure the update worked.

## **What to Do If Third-Party Cartridges Stop Working After a Firmware Update**

After a Brother printer firmware update, many users report issues with third-party cartridges no longer being recognized. This can create an immediate Brother printer issue, requiring urgent action. Here are some practical Brother printer troubleshooting steps and workarounds that may help restore functionality:

1. **Reseat the Cartridge:** Remove the ink or toner, wait a few seconds, then reinstall it. This often resets the connection between the printer and cartridge.
2. **Power Cycle the Printer:** Turn off the printer, unplug it, wait 60 seconds, then power it back on. This simple reset can help [fix Brother printer offline](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-brother-printer-offline-for-mac-and-windows.html) errors or cartridge recognition issues.
3. **Check Cartridge Compatibility:** After a firmware update, Brother printer, older or generic cartridges may no longer work. Check with the cartridge manufacturer for firmware-compatible versions. 
4. **Use OEM Cartridges:** If third-party cartridges stop working after you update the firmware Brother printer, try using official Brother supplies temporarily. They are always compatible with the latest firmware.
5. **Roll Back Firmware:** Some models allow you to update firmware Brother printer back to a previous version. Visit [Brother’s support site](https://support.brother.com/) to see if a rollback is available for your model.
6. **Turn Off Firmware Updates:** If you're using third-party or refilled cartridges, it's recommended to disable automatic firmware updates. Brother occasionally releases firmware that blocks non-original cartridges, even if they were working fine before. These updates are designed to enforce compatibility with genuine Brother supplies, which can cause third-party cartridges to be rejected or trigger error messages. Turning off firmware updates gives you more control and helps avoid unexpected interruptions or added costs due to cartridge lockouts. You can still check for updates manually when needed—just make sure you're aware of what the update includes before installing it.

A. **Option 1:** From the Printer Control Panel (Note: Not all models have this option)

* Press the **Menu** or **Settings** button.
* Navigate to **Machine Info** or **All Settings**.
* Select **Firmware Auto Update**.
* Choose **Off** or **Manual Update**.

B. **Option 2:** From Brother Software (Windows or Mac)

* Open **Brother Utilities** (Windows) or **iPrint&Scan** (Mac).
* Go to **Tools** or **Settings**.
* Look for **Update Settings** or **Firmware Update Settings**.
* Set to **Off**, **Never**, or **Notify Only** (depending on options shown).

C. **Option 3:** Brother Firmware Update Tool

* Open the **Brother Firmware Update Tool** (if installed).
* Uncheck or disable the option for **Automatic Firmware Updates**.

7. **Try Community Hacks:** Some users on forums share unofficial fixes or downgrade tools. These may help restore third-party compatibility after a firmware update on Brother printer, but they may also void your warranty or cause further issues.

## **Final Thoughts:** 

Updating your Brother printer firmware is now a routine part of printer maintenance. These updates often fix bugs, boost speed, improve security, and support newer operating systems. Many users report better performance after installing a firmware update Brother printer from the official site. But for those using non-OEM cartridges, updates can trigger a Brother printer issue, like cartridge lockouts or blocked printing. Some updates also can’t be rolled back. That’s why users with working setups often avoid them. Smart update management can prevent downtime, reduce costs, and even fix Brother printer offline errors.
