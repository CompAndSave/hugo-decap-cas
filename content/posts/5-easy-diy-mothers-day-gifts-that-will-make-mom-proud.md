![DIY Mother's Day](/blog/images/momflower.jpg "Paper flowers for Mother's Day")

You don't need to spend a lot of money to get your mom's attention this Mother's Day. We have several ideas for DIY Mother's Day gifts that don't cost much or require a lot of time. Get your printer ready with CompAndSave's [high-quality ink](https://www.compandsave.com) and [specialty papers](https://www.compandsave.com/paper). It's time to shower your mother with love. Let's begin!  

## 5 Easy and Affordable DIY Mother's Day Gift Ideas

### 1\. Cards

Make Momma a homemade card using custom designs. You can use Word or even PowerPoint to create simple designs. Step it up a notch and use Canva or a graphic design program to create flowers, animals, pretty fonts, and more. As long as your [color ink](https://www.compandsave.com/) is full, you should have no problems printing a variety of colorful Mother's Day cards.

You can also use scissors and pretty paper, ribbons, or other material to cut out designs and affix to heavy-stock colored paper. Here is a fun [butterfly card](https://www.bhg.com/holidays/mothers-day/cards/make-mothers-day-card/?slideId=781f0d80-f5d2-4586-9618-f4b74a2a079b) and [another butterfly card design](https://www.bhg.com/holidays/mothers-day/cards/make-mothers-day-card/?slideId=681b32e7-88fa-4eef-9850-a0fa4a96e913).

### 2\. Framed Photos and Art

Print out one of Mom's favorite photos and frame it for her. Choose from [glossy](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/glossy), [matte](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/matte), or [luster](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/photo-paper/lustre)photo paper depending on how you want your photo to look. For that special homemade or printed artwork, our [printable fabric papers](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/printable-fabric) give art a professional, gallery-quality look.

### 3\. Shirt, Bag, and More

Offer your mother a truly unique gift. Using our [transfer paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/transfer-paper/inkjet), you can create an original shirt, bag, or dish towel just for Mom. Throwing a Mother's Day brunch? Try printing the brunch menu or fun sayings on a [cloth napkin](https://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/how-to/g771/mothers-day-crafts-0509/?slide=51).

### 4\. Flowers

Gift your mom some flowers, just not the usual expensive bouquet of fresh flowers. Make Mom paper flowers instead of fresh—they'll last longer! If you've ever looked at paper flower projects on Pinterest or YouTube, you'll know how pretty and lifelike they can be. And they aren't very difficult to make. Just get colorful paper or print out a design on white paper, and use one of the many available tutorials to make color flowers. Feel free to try this [tutorial](https://www.countryliving.com/diy-crafts/how-to/g771/mothers-day-crafts-0509/?slide=38), [this one](https://www.instructables.com/id/Tissue-Paper-Flowers/), or this [other one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCdgIxWfvaQ). 

### 5\. Recipes

Any mom who likes to cook will appreciate this next DIY idea. Type her favorite recipes and print on notecards or paper. Then, assemble in a booklet using staples or [thread](https://www.instructables.com/id/Format-Print-and-Assemble-a-hand-sewn-Booklet/). Your mother will love that all the best recipes are organized in one spot—no more misplacing a recipe and being frazzled when trying to cook dinner.
