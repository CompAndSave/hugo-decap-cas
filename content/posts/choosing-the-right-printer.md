Buying a new printer is a task many people will need to undergo, but there's more to choosing the right printer than brand reputation and cost. Your selection should be based on fact rather than supposition; it should be based on demonstrated value and quality, not mere reputation. To help you make the right choice, this article will lay out the basic features of the two types of printers, give you a number of technical specifications, and provide a few helpful contrasts to help you make an informed decision with confidence. 

First, there are some differences between inkjet printers and laser printers that anyone contemplating buying one or the other ought to know about. Inkjet printers apply liquid ink through nozzles on paper; laser printers get results through fused [toner powder](http://localhost/blogger-to-wp/2013/08/07/what-exactly-is-toner/). To avoid smudges, you must use the best quality paper and printer ink. Indeed, that is the only way that you will be able to guarantee the documents you print are of the very best.

When it comes to choosing the printer, the first thing you must determine is what you will use the printer for. The nature of your job will determine the kind of printer you need. It is essential for you to bear in mind that not all jobs are suitable for office printers. If, for example, you need to print exhibit-quality photos, then you should go to a professional photo inkjet that produces high resolution images. If the most vivid and clear images is what you need, then you are better off with a laser printer. Perhaps you are opening your own business or maybe you want a [personal printer at home](http://localhost/blogger-to-wp/2013/12/03/best-inkjet-printers-for-your-home-whats-recommended-and-why/) to print out private documents. The frequency with which you anticipate using the printer and the general purpose that you intend for the device should all be considered before you make a purchasing decision. 

You must also shop and compare brands. It may be overwhelming at first, as you have a wide selection. A few high-cost brands no longer control the market. You can get a good printer without paying an exorbitant amount of money. The key thing is to shop around both online and in electronic specialty stores. The latter are sometimes the best places to go to find a high quality printer at a bargain. The nature of your profession and business determines all of the investment decisions you make, and you should look at this purchase as an investment decision—as something that will increase your productivity. 

So, here is a summary of the pros and cons of inkjet and laser printers: 

**Inkjet Printers**  
Pros: 
* Inkjet printers tend to be more compact; they are easily handled and do not take up a lot of space
* [Prints photos](https://www.compandsave.com/paper?utm%5Fmedium=social&utm%5Fsource=blog), images, and colors in better quality (this is especially beneficial for photographers)
* They are inexpensive when compared to laser printers
* You don't need to warm the machine
* You are not limited in the type of paper you can print on
* You can use paper sizes of all kinds—large, small, and medium
* [Ink refill kits](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-refill-bulk-ink?utm%5Fmedium=social&utm%5Fsource=blog) can reduce the cost of printing

Cons:

* Much slower than laser printers (this can affect projects that require printing in large amounts)
* Ink replacements can be more frequent and more pricey
* Low-capacity paper trays of 50 to 100 sheets, which can be frustrating for a user who prints a lot
* Low monthly duty cycle

**Laser Printers**

Pros:

* Print faster than inkjet, which is beneficial if your business requires the printing of high volumes of materials
* Laser printers produce sharp text, which is great for text documents
* If your work requires the mass production of black and white documents, then you are safe with a laser printer—though there are brands that do print in color
* Higher monthly duty cycle means they are better prepared to handle high-volume jobs
* Toner is inexpensive

Cons:

* Can handle simple graphics, but complex images and photos are a challenge
* Although there are some compact laser printers on the market, they are generally bigger and heavier than inkjet printers
* Laser printers can't handle the same variety of paper that inkjets can
* The cost you have to pay for supplies for a laser printer is more than that for an inkjet printer

With all of this in mind, it is time to choose the kind of printer you want. Once you have made your purchase, remember that you will commit yourself to the maintenance and resupply of the machine that you chose. When it comes down to it, you must weigh and measure a range of factors before you make a final decision. You must consider not only the type of printer but the brand you purchase, as they do differ in capacity, volume, and quality. This is a lot to take in, but rest assured knowing you will feel confident in your decision and, with proper care and maintenance, a reliable printer for years to come.
