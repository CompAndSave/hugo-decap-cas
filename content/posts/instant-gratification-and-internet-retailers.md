**Well Thought Out Infrastructure Is the Sign of a Good Company**

The merging of the real world and cyberspace has never been in greater harmony than it is now; in quite a few cities, you can order an ink or laser toner cartridge, like the Compatible Okidata C5500/C5650/C5800 Series toner cartridge, and have the cartridge at your place of business in a few days - and in many areas, the next day.

Of course, to deliver on this platform takes expertise and an efficient, well thought out plan that needs to be spread between the cyber and real world platforms. It is not easy to set up the infrastructure in both worlds so that they seamlessly overlap into one easy experience for the online customer.

**How Not To Be Fooled By a Fancy Website with a Worn, Poorly Run Warehouse**

As an individual, the customer just wants a seamless transaction; they don't think about the giant inventory a good seller has to keep in this field; such hard to find items like the Canon FaxPhone B-540 [Ink Cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/). Seamlessly integrating warehousing and shipping systems can also be a delicate procedure, but you can tell the well thought out, dedicated online supplier by gauging just a few things. For instance, especially for inkjet cartridges and other printer and toner cartridges one of the things to look for is that they only offer this type of supply - it is usually a bad thing when cheap cartridges are available from a retailer who carries a panoply of other products.

Shipping and warranty terms should be spelled out in easy to understand language, and the good website almost always offer same day shipping if an order is placed early enough. That is one of the strengths of this cross platform integration when done right - it means that someone is paying attention at the company, so seeing these things lets you know that as much thought went into the back end of the company as has gone into the website. One is useless without the other.
