February is American Heart Month and a great opportunity to raise awareness of heart disease. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm), heart disease is responsible for 1 in 4 deaths in the United States. It can take many forms that can ultimately lead to heart failure. It is very important to take some time to educate yourself on ways to reduce the risk of heart disease. A healthy heart is a happy heart, and here's 4 ways you can lead a healthy lifestyle. 

#### 

####   

#### Get in Daily Exercise

Ideally, you should get at least 2.5 hours a week of exercise. If this sounds intimidating, break it down by the day. That's only 30 minutes 5 days a week. Make this time a priority and really focus on achieving those personal goals.  
  
#### Establish a Healthy Diet

Healthy diets are key to a healthier heart. Superfoods (i.e. - almonds, blueberries, avocados, etc.) have a wide range of health benefits that can kick-start a healthier lifestyle by making you feel better, look good and give you TONS of energy so you can get in that 30 minute workout.   
  
#### Schedule Some "You" Time

If you don't already have time set aside each week to do something you enjoy, you are allowing your stress levels to build up overtime. The more you stress, the more you put yourself at risk for heart disease. Set aside a little time each week to do a hobby you enjoy. Whether that is getting lost in a good book or spending some time outside, find your stress-free happy place.   
  
#### Get Regular Checkups

Even if you follow a healthy lifestyle, it's smart to get regular health checkups. If you have a history of heart disease in the family, it's even more critical to get regular checkups. It's important to be aware of your health risks and know the signs. Having all the right information is a great start to lowering your risk of heart disease.
