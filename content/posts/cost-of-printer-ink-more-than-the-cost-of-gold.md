According to an graphic that was created by NineMSN, Printer Ink: What It Really Costs, a comparison is given that lists several types of liquids, including printer ink, and gives the price if bought in liters. One of their results showed that printer ink that comes in new printer cartridges or toner [ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/), can cost more than a bottle of Chanel Number 5 perfume! 

The printer ink cartridge that was used as the model (an HP printer ink cartridge) the cost for the ink, if purchased by the liter, would be over $5500 per liter. And this was for black printer ink! If you were to buy color ink the cost would be much higher. This particular new printer ink cartridge holds about 4.5 ml of ink and normally runs about $25 for that 4.5 ml.

Some of the other types of liquids that were compared included liquid gold, beer, gasoline, and water. Of course, water was the cheapest when compared to printer ink and even beer and gasoline came in under most of the other liquids that were examined. While all of this is interesting, what does it have to do with you? After all, how often do you go out and buy a quart of liquid gold?

The answer is simple: if you own or operate a printer in your home or business, you will, at some time or another, have to refill the ink cartridge or toner ink cartridge. You have a couple of options here. You can purchase OEM ink cartridges, these are the printer ink cartridges that are manufactured by the maker of the printer, or you can purchase your printer ink cartridges and toner cartridges from other sources.

A major drawback to purchasing OEM printer ink cartridges is price. These are the most expensive types of replacement ink cartridges and were used in the comparison test mentioned above. These replacement ink cartridges are, of course, considered to be perfectly matched for the individual printer that they fit. But, that does not mean that they are the only perfect match for any particular printer.

A much less expensive way of obtaining replacing printer ink cartridges is to purchase cartridges that are not manufactured by the printer company. You can find these easily online nowadays, and the cost savings can be dramatic. The same holds true for toner ink cartridges and other types of printer ink supply sources.

It is important, however, to buy from trusted online sources that stand behind their products. Not all online vendors are as honest as the next, and you want to avoid problems with inferior replacements whenever possible. So, choose the printer ink vendor that offers the best service, products, and prices wisely.
