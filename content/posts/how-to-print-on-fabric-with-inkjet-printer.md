## Selecting the Right Fabric: How to Print on Fabric with Inkjet Printer

Choosing the appropriate fabric is the first critical step in the inkjet printing on fabric process. The most popular choices include:

* **Cotton:** Highly absorbent and versatile, cotton is ideal for achieving vibrant and long-lasting prints.
* **Canvas:** Known for its durability, the canvas is perfect for items that need a sturdier fabric, such as tote bags and art reproductions.
* **Polyester:** This synthetic fabric is excellent for projects that need resistance to water or stretching, like outdoor flags and sportswear.
* **Silk:** For those looking to add a touch of luxury, silk is the go-to fabric. Its lustrous finish is perfect for scarves and upscale apparel.

**How to print fabric on inkjet printer:** Pre-washing your fabric before you print is crucial to remove any impurities that could affect the inkâ€™s absorption. After washing, ironing the fabric ensures a smooth and even surface, which helps achieve the best print quality.

## Preparing Your Design for Inkjet Printing on Fabric

Creating a standout fabric print begins with a well-prepared design. Here are essential guidelines to ensure your artwork looks great when transferred to fabric:

* **Resolution:** Ensure your design is set at a high resolution, between 150-300 DPI (dots per inch). This detail ensures that your print is sharp and clear, especially important for intricate patterns and detailed images.
* **Color Profiles:** Convert your artwork to the CMYK color model, which is used by most inkjet printers. This change is crucial for matching the colors in your design with those produced by the printer.
* **Orientation:** Adjust the orientation of your design based on how it will be positioned on the fabric. If necessary, mirror your design especially when creating designs for T-shirts or other apparel to ensure it appears once printed.
* **Test Prints:** Before printing on the actual fabric, conduct several test prints on paper. This step allows you to verify color accuracy and the look of your design, making adjustments as needed without wasting fabric.

For cost-effective printing, consider using one of the [best refillable inkjet printers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/best-refillable-inkjet-printer-our-top-4-picks.html). These printers not only reduce the ongoing cost of ink but also support high-quality prints suitable for fabric.
