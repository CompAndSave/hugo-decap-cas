Always look to buy ink that is specifically designed for your model of printer and ink cartridge. Each different printer requires a unique formula of ink to be able to work to its best standards, and using the wrong ink can permanently damage your printer.

Another good tip is to never wait until your ink cartridge is empty, doing this will only make sure that the remaining ink left in the cartridge will dry and block the cartridge outlets. Attempting to refill a damaged cartridge will only mean damage to your printer and a very poor quality of a final print.  
Always make sure you fill the correct cartridge with the correct inks, as once you have made a mistake, it is impossible to reverse it. Always seek to read the manufacturer's instructions when attempting to carry out the task of refilling your ink cartridges.
