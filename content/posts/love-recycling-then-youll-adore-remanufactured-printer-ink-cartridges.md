Here at [CompandSave](https://www.compandsave.com/), we're all about preserving the environment. That's why we promote the use of remanufactured printer cartridges — they're much better for the environment because they're made from previously used cartridges. That's recycling! There's no need to create a brand new cartridge if a remanufactured/recycled printer ink cartridge works just as well!

A lot of people have worries about using remanufactured ink cartridges. Original equipment manufacturer (OEM) cartridge manufacturers (in other words, companies that make cartridges _and_ the printers they're used with) try to persuade customers not to use remanufactured ink cartridges by saying to customers that using non-brand cartridges will violate their printer's warranty. Of course, this is not true. It is actually illegal to void a person's warranty in that case. This is just a way for the manufacturer to protect their own profit by selling printer ink cartridges worth [several thousand dollars](https://blog.compandsave.com/2012/10/cost-of-printer-ink-more-than-cost-of.html) per gallon.

[![recycling $100 bills](/blog/images/money-hundreds-recycling.jpeg "recycling $100 bills")](/blog/images/money-hundreds-recycling.jpeg)On the other hand, remanufactured printer ink cartridges are created from a previously used printer ink cartridge. Each one is purchased from an OEM company by a remanufactured printer ink cartridge company (like us!) and fixed up for more uses. The cost of a remanufactured printer ink cartridge depends on the cost of the original cartridge, but they are usually much less expensive than the average OEM printer ink cartridge. This can save you a lot of money over time!

The value in using remanufactured printer cartridges over OEM cartridges is enormous. On average, every printer ink cartridge that is thrown away instead of recycled is eventually turned into 3.5 pounds of solid waste. That would take between 400 and 1,000 years to decompose!

Currently, only a small percentage of printer ink cartridges are ever recycled — only about [one in every 500](https://printerinkcartridges.printcountry.com/printcountry-articles/inkjet-recycling-and-buyback-recycled-empty-cartridges-related-articles/how-many-ink-cartridges-are-recycled-how-many-go-to-the-landfill)! This means that over 350 million cartridges are thrown away instead of recycled every year. We're doing our part to save some of the world's plastic (and save you money!) by giving you the best remanufactured printer ink cartridges on the market. But we should all do our part by recycling and purchasing products that promote recycling. The earth's depending on it!
