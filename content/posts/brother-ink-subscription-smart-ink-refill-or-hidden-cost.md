The Brother printer ink subscription tracks your ink levels through your connected Brother printer. When you're low, new ink ships automatically—no effort from you. It’s monthly, flexible, and easy to manage.

It’s part of a growing shift toward printer ink subscription services, much like [HP Instant Ink](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/what-is-hp-instant-ink-program-is-it-worth-it.html), but made specifically for Brother users.

## **Step-by-Step Operation of the Brother Printer Subscription**

3. **Automatic Ordering:** When ink runs low, the Brother Print subscription automatically triggers an order for new cartridges.
4. **Delivery:** Ink cartridges are shipped directly to your address with free shipping.

### **Activation and Compatible Models**

To start, you register your printer via your Brother account and enroll in the Brother printer ink subscription. Only certain models support this service, mostly recent Brother inkjet and laser printers with cloud connectivity.

Once activated, the system handles everything automatically. You can manage your plan, print limits, and shipping preferences through your account.


**Brother Ink Subscription Plans and Pricing**

Choosing the right subscription plan depends on how much you print monthly. Brother offers flexible plans designed to suit different printing needs. This makes it easier than ever to avoid the hassle of having to buy ink cartridges often.

## **Pros and Cons of the Brother Printer Ink Subscription**

Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of the Brother ink subscription helps you decide if it fits your printing needs better than buying ink cartridges as needed. This section breaks down key advantages and disadvantages to keep in mind before subscribing.

### **Pros of the Brother Subscription**

* **Never run out of ink:** The Brother Print subscription automatically delivers ink when levels are low. This prevents unexpected printer stops, a common frustration for users relying on [aftermarket ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/truth-behind-third-party-ink-cartridges-cheaper-alternative.html).
* **Predictable monthly costs:** With fixed monthly fees based on your plan, the Brother printer subscription makes budgeting simple and avoids surprise expenses.
* **Free shipping and recycling programs:** Ink cartridges arrive at your door with no extra cost. Brother also encourages the eco-friendly recycling of used cartridges.
* **Easier tracking of ink usage:** The Brother EZ print subscription service tracks your ink levels automatically and notifies you, so you stay informed without checking manually.

### **Cons of the Brother Subscription**

* **Locked into a subscription model:** Once signed up, you’re committed to monthly payments. This can be a downside for those who prefer flexibility.
* **May be more expensive for low-volume users:** If you print rarely, the subscription might cost more than buying cartridges as needed or using aftermarket ink cartridges.
* **Limited flexibility compared to buying as needed:** You can’t easily switch ink types or brands; the service delivers only genuine Brother ink.
* **Some reports of functionality issues without subscription:** Certain Brother printers might require an active subscription to operate fully, which can be inconvenient for users who want to avoid subscriptions.

### **Is Brother  Subscription Better Than Buying Cartridges as Needed?**

The Brother subscription is ideal for frequent users. It offers automatic delivery, tracks ink levels, and ensures you never run out. It's cost-effective if you print regularly. For occasional users, buying cartridges as needed may be cheaper. However, it requires manual tracking and can lead to last-minute ink shortages.

## **How to Cancel the Brother EZ print subscription?**

Many users want to know how to pause or cancel their Brother ink subscription if their printing needs change. To pause or cancel your Brother Print subscription, log in to your subscription account online. From there, you can manage your plan settings easily. Choose to pause if you want to stop shipments temporarily or cancel completely to end the service.

### **What Happens After You Cancel the Brother Printer Subscription?**

Once canceled, your printer will no longer receive automatic ink shipments. However, most Brother printers still function without an active subscription, unlike some competitors. You will need to buy ink cartridges manually—either genuine Brother ink or aftermarket ink cartridges—to keep printing.

Keep in mind that skipping subscription ink may disable some features in specific models, so check your printer’s manual.

## **Conclusion**

The Brother ink subscription offers a simple, hands-off way to stay stocked on ink. It's perfect for users who print often and want to avoid last-minute ink runs. With options like the subscription, you can pick a plan that fits your monthly needs. You also get perks like rollover pages, free shipping, and eco-friendly recycling.

However, it’s not ideal for everyone. Light users or those who prefer flexibility may save more by buying ink when needed. Still, the convenience and reliability make the Brother printer subscription a strong contender in the growing [printer ink subscription](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/printer-ink-subscription-or-buy-ink-cartridges-which-saves-more.html) market—right alongside services like HP Instant Ink.
