It is an all important decision to make, when it comes to choosing a printer that will be able to produce what you need, Not only do you have to take your needs into consideration, but you also need to think about how much the printer would cost you, when the time comes to replace your old ink cartridge. For many of us this time will seem to come very quickly and we will always seem to be spending money on [replacement ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/). 

There are however many different methods and settings you could employ that will help make that ink cartridge last a little longer, and ultimately bring down the money you spend on a printer cartridges every month. Not everybody will use their printer for the same printing process, some of us will use our printer for the latest family photos, while others am use their printer every day for their children's homework. It just all depends on your circumstances some will use a lot of black ink, while others will prefer to print everything using a color scheme.

However one thing, which we all will have in common, is that we all wish to achieve the final outcome, spending as little money as we can, without making the final result suffer.

We will always need to use the services of a printer for as long as you own a computer, using the internet you can find every little bit of information you need. It may be new recipe that you wish to try for tonight's family meal, all you have to do is press print and the recipe will be there waiting to be used. So there will seem to be no way of escaping using our ink.

There is however a light at the end of tunnel, and now never again will you have spent massive amounts of money on OEM ink cartridges, as you can acquire the same result, using a compatible cartridge at a fraction of the cost. Compatible ink cartridges are played down as being an inferior product in the industry and big name brands recommend that we stay away from them.

There is only one reason for this and it is not because they can damage your printer or any other similar argument you may have heard, it is because the big name brands are beginning to worry, due to the rapid increase in the sales figures of Compatible ink cartridges. There is a very valid reason for this, people are now beginning to see the amazing benefits that come with the compatible ink cartridges, and also the price looks a lot more appealing than that of the OEM cartridge.
