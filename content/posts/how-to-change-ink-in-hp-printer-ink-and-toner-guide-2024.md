## How to Replace Ink in HP Printer: Know What Ink It Uses

Knowing how to change printer ink and toner should begin with the basics. The first important question you need to ask yourself is, "What ink do I need for my HP printer?" Getting the right HP ink is the initial step to ensure the cartridge fits in the printer for a smoother installation process. Here’s how to determine the correct ink for your HP printer:

### 1. Check Your Printer Model

The model number is usually found on the front, back, or bottom of the printer. It’s often a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., HP DeskJet 3755).

### 2. Refer to the Printer Manual

The user manual that came with your printer contains a section on consumables, where it lists the compatible ink cartridges. If you’ve misplaced the manual, you can usually download a digital copy from HP’s website by searching for your printer model.

### 3. Look at Existing Cartridges

Carefully open the access door to see the installed cartridges. Note the part numbers and any identifying information printed on them (e.g., HP 63, HP 952). This ensures you buy the exact replacements.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. How to check ink levels on HP printer?

The easiest way to know if your HP printer is out of ink is if it is not producing prints anymore. But we don't want to go that far. Checking the ink levels of your HP printer will help you get prepared before you run out of ink. Most printers will notify you with an alert on the display when your ink is low and when it is time to replace your cartridge or refill your ink. For older models that do not have this function, broken text and white streaks on prints indicate that it's time to swap for a new cartridge. You can follow the steps below on how to check the ink levels on an HP printer:

**STEP 1:** If you are using a Windows computer, download HP Print and Scan Doctor.

**STEP 2:** Click Tools then Printer/Supply Levels. It will show the ink levels of your HP printer.

### 2. How to store ink cartridges when not in use?

It is essential to take care of your cartridges to avoid drying up or getting damaged. To ensure you get the most out of your HP ink cartridges, store them in a cool, dry place at a room temperature of 20-29 degrees Celsius. Do not open the packaging unless you are ready to install the cartridges, and avoid touching the circuitry to prevent printing quality issues. Always check the shelf life of your printer inks, and have new ink cartridges ready before installing them to prevent the nozzles from drying out.

### 3. What should I do if my printer doesn't recognize the new ink cartridge?

If your printer doesn't recognize the new ink cartridge, there are several steps you can take to resolve the issue. First, ensure that the cartridge is securely installed in its slot. Sometimes, cartridges may not click into place correctly, leading to recognition issues. Next, check and clean the electrical contacts on both the cartridge and inside the printer using a lint-free cloth lightly dampened with water. Another reason is that the printer firmware was updated and can’t recognize the cartridge. To downgrade it, follow this guide on [how to downgrade HP printer firmware](https://www.compandsave.com/hp-printer-firmware-downgrade).
