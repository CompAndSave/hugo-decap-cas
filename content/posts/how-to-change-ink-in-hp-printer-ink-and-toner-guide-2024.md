## How to Replace Ink in HP Printer: Know What Ink It Uses

Knowing how to change printer ink and toner should begin with the basics. The first important question you need to ask yourself is, "What ink do I need for my HP printer?" Getting the right HP ink is the initial step to ensure the cartridge fits in the printer for a smoother installation process. Here’s how to determine the correct ink for your HP printer:

The model number is usually found on the front, back, or bottom of the printer. It’s often a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., HP DeskJet 3755).

### 2. Refer to the Printer Manual

The user manual that came with your printer contains a section on consumables, where it lists the compatible ink cartridges. If you’ve misplaced the manual, you can usually download a digital copy from HP’s website by searching for your printer model.

### 3. Look at Existing Cartridges

Carefully open the access door to see the installed cartridges. Note the part numbers and any identifying information printed on them (e.g., HP 63, HP 952). This ensures you buy the exact replacements.
