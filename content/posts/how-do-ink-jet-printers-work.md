The printing industry has come a long way since the first printers has been released onto the market. These first printers were introduced in the late 1980's, however as they were a new product they were overpriced and not really fit for use. They were always breaking down and not producing the results we had required. This was basically a trial and error stage for the industry, and many top brands of printer today were at the foundations of the growth of the printer, that was to come. 

All of the early printers had used ink jet technology, there was always the capability to produce excellent results, and we had just not found it yet. The way in which this technology works, is the printer will use ink cartridges as its very own source of ink. Once you request the printer to work for you, the image or document is sent to the printer's memory. Once the printer has gained knowledge of the task it needs to complete for you, the print head will begin the process as it passes tiny droplets of ink onto the paper or material you wish to print on. 

It is a very basic process yet many people do not actually know how the ink jet printer works. Through being able to have knowledge of this process, it will also help you to recognise problems that you may have with your printer. If the printer does not work or you or of the printer produces poor final images or documents, then this is a clear indication that there may be a problem with the print head. The print head is seen as the most important part of the printer, therefore if something goes wrong with it, you may need to buy a new printer. 

You can carry out simple maintenance which will prevent the appearance of any problems, and all that is needed in many scenarios is a gentle wipe of the actual print head. The ink jet printer in the market of today can be found at a low price, and with a fantastic range of new technologies integrated as a part of the system.
