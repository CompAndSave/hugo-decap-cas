Google allows you to register your printer to your Google account, which then lets you print using a compatible network device like a phone, tablet, or PC. The technology also lets you share your printers with anyone you choose and lets you print without having to install device drivers (which send documents fully transmitted to Google). You can print from any Windows application if a cloud printer is installed on the device.

While you can print from some other printers as well, a cloud ready printer is best and will give you optimal results with the least effort. Below, we look at some of the best cloud ready printers on the market today.
