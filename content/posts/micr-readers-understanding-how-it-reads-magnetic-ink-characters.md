Do you ever wonder how banks process your checks so quickly and accurately? Well, the secret lies in a fascinating technology called Magnetic Ink Character Recognition, or MICR for short. But how are they read? Let’s find out in this guide how they use MICR readers to scan and interpret the magnetic ink characters on checks. Whether you're just curious and seeking to learn more about banking technology or a professional looking to enhance your knowledge of MICR, this guide will give you insights into MICR technology. So, let's dive in and learn how a magnetic ink character reader works!

**In this guide, we will discuss:**

* Magnetic Ink Characters: What Are These?
* Magnetic Ink Character Recognition Reader: Advantages
* Magnetic Ink Character Reader: Exploring 4 Types
* MICR Readers: How Do They Work?

## Magnetic Ink Characters: What Are These?

Magnetic ink characters are special characters printed using magnetic ink or toner, typically found at the bottom of checks and other financial documents. They contain essential information such as routing numbers, account numbers, and check numbers. These characters are designed to be easily readable by machines called MICR readers, which use magnetic sensors to interpret the information encoded in the characters.

Checks have numbers written in two unique fonts: E-13B and CMC-7. E-13B is more common in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom, while CMC-7 is used more in Europe and parts of South America. These styles help machines quickly and accurately read check numbers.

## Magnetic Ink Character Recognition Reader: Advantages

Magnetic Ink Character Recognition readers are handy devices used in banks and businesses to quickly and accurately process checks and other important documents. But what makes them so useful? Let's explore some reasons why:

### 1. High Accuracy

MICR Readers are great at reading special magnetic ink, like the one used in the [HP 79A MICR toner cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/79a-micr-toner-cartridge-cf279a-black) for printing checks. This means they make very few mistakes when reading the numbers and letters on checks.

### 2. Fast Processing

They can go through lots of checks quickly. This helps banks and other places that deal with a lot of checks every day.

### 3. Compatibility

MICR device can read different kinds of documents, not just checks. This includes deposit slips, payment vouchers, and other types of financial instruments that also use MICR encoding. So, they're helpful for various financial papers that use the same magnetic ink.

### 4. Durability

MICR Readers are built to endure frequent use and tough environmental conditions, ensuring they remain reliable over the long term, especially in demanding environments.

## Magnetic Ink Character Reader: Exploring 4 Types

Different kinds of MICR readers are designed to fit different business needs and hold different amounts of checks. They make it easier for businesses to read magnetic ink characters on checks quickly and accurately. Let's take a look at each type:

### 1. Magnetic Stripe Readers

Magnetic stripe readers are machines that can read the stripe on the back of cards like credit cards or the bottom of MICR checks. They work by sensing the magnetized bits on the stripe. This magnetic ink character reader is common and not too expensive. They're used in places where you swipe cards, like stores or ATMs. Banks also use them to process checks quickly. The problem is that the stripe can get damaged easily, causing errors when reading. Also, they need regular cleaning and maintenance to work well.

### 2. Scanning Readers

This type of scanner uses special technology to read all parts of a check, including the MICR line, and change it into digital information. These machines are better at accuracy compared to ones that read magnetic stripes. They can even read checks that are damaged or have poor print quality. But, these scanning machines are pricier than the magnetic stripe   and need more computer power to work.

### 3. Hybrid Readers

Hybrid readers are like a mix of two types of readers: magnetic stripe and scanning. They can understand both the magnetic stripe and the MICR line on a check. They're good at reading checks and usually cost less than scanners. But they can also get damaged and might not read damaged checks.

### 4. Portable Readers

Portable readers are compact devices you can take wherever you go. They're handy for businesses needing to read outside checks, such as delivery companies. You can easily connect them to phones or laptops. However, they can be more expensive than other options and might not be as effective at reading checks as larger machines.
