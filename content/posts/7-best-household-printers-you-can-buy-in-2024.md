## Best Household Printer: What Kind of Printer User Are You?

Before advancing forward, you must determine the purpose for which you need the printer.

### 1. For Usage at Home 

For domestic use, printers must be adaptable and multipurpose. Additionally, the printer will be utilized for a variety of outputs because a large number of people may require it. You may print out pamphlets, essays, or pictures using it. Therefore, a robust and adaptable printer must be on your shopping list.

When comparing [inkjet vs laser printers](https://www.compandsave.com/inkjet-vs-laser-printer-guide), colored inkjet printers are ideal for home use. These printers are quick and capable of printing nearly anything. Even more helpful are the integrated scanner, fax, and photocopier that some inkjet printers feature.

### 2. Business Use 

An efficient and robust printer is necessary for numerous printing tasks. Large organizations and corporate offices can benefit greatly from laser printers, particularly those designed for business use. Faster CPUs and robust print engines that can handle numerous printing sessions are features of these models.

Ensure the printer you purchase for your office has network printing capabilities and high-capacity cartridges.

### 3. For Photography

Photographers must have their images printed in vivid colors. The best printer is an inkjet one since it can accommodate the kind of ink set, color management software, and compatible paper you require.

So, the best home photo printer would be the one with various ink cartridges that can be purchased, and as each color runs out, a new one can be installed. Instead of replacing your empty three-color cartridges with new ones every time, this will enable you to save even more money.
