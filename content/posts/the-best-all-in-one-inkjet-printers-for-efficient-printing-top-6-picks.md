## Finding The Best All-in-One Inkjet Printer: 6 Top Picks 

Looking for the best inkjet printer can feel like a quest for the holy grail of office equipment. With the right choice, you'll streamline your workflow, enhance productivity, and maybe even add a touch of excitement to your printing tasks. So, let's explore the top 6 picks for the best inkjet color printer all-in-one on the market.

### 1. HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e Wireless Color

HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e Wireless Color is the first on our list of the best multifunction inkjet printer. It is the ideal option for most users and meets the demands of a small business as well. It includes an automated document feeder (ADF) that can scan, fax, copy, and quickly print color and black-and-white documents.

You can print 18 pages per minute (ppm) in color printing and up to 22 PPM in monochrome. It is always possible to print on both sides and scan on both sides, saving time and reducing the possibility of human error.

**Pros**

* A paper tray with 250 sheets.
* Integrated security measures.
* A reasonable price.
* 40% of the material is recycled plastic.

### 2. Brother MFC-L8905CDW

The Brother MFC-L8905CDW, a color laser model, is also considered the best multifunction inkjet printer after HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e. It prints at a speed of up to 32 pages per minute. It creates remarkably crisp documents and requires little upkeep. Its ADF-equipped scanner scans quickly and allows for single-pass duplex scanning, which makes it an excellent option for workplaces that frequently scan documents with many pages on both sides.

Unless you print a lot, you probably won't need to replace the toner cartridges very often because they yield about 3000 black and 1400 color prints. Furthermore, the cost of the cheapest toner cartridges is not too high. 

**Pros**

* Fast printing for high-volume needs.
* Wireless connectivity.
* Huge paper capacity.
* Advanced Scanning Functions.
* Duplex printing for paper and cost savings.
* High-quality output for professional documents.
