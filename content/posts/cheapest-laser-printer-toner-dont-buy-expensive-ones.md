Does using the cheapest laser printer toner instead of ink save you more money? Absolutely! Toner cartridges, used in laser printers, can print up to thousands of pages, making them more cost-effective for high-volume printing than inkjet printers. This is one of the reasons why toner cartridges are best for offices or small businesses. 

But with many choices available, how can we find the cheapest laser printer cartridges? Well, in this guide, we listed our top picks for laser printer toners, including the cost per page.

## Cheapest Toner For Laser Printer: Factors To Consider Before Buying

If you are running an office or a small business, you need to consider several things before purchasing the correct cheap printer toner for your needs. To get the most value for your money, focus on the price of toner cartridges instead of the laser printer itself. This will help you save much more in the long run. Additionally, consider asking yourself these questions:

* Do you print frequently or not? 
* How much does the toner cost? 
* Does it have a higher-yield toner available? 
* Do you print mostly in black and white or do you also need the color toner cartridges? 

If you are looking for the cheapest toner cartridge, you should first know the answer to the above questions. The toners may look the same and do not differ in size, but a **higher yield means there is more toner powder** inside than the standard ones, meaning you can print more pages with it. Thus, you will not need to replace your toner cartridge often. Some standard toner cartridges can produce up to 3,000 prints. In comparison, there are higher-yield toners that can give you as much as 20,000 printouts.

Check how many pages you print on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. If you print daily, it's best to buy higher-yield cartridges because they offer a much lower cost per page compared to standard-yield cartridges. Also, some toners have built-in drum units, which you need to replace when the toner runs out. It can be a bit pricey, but this type of toner is best if you are after quality printing.

On the other hand, if low-cost printing is your priority, calculate the cost per page. There are toners with a separate drum unit, and you only need to replace them after changing toners 3 to 4 times which is a great way to save. Using a toner for a compact and easy-to-use laser printer is the way to go for students or those working at home.

## Cheapest Laser Printer Cartridges: Know How To Calculate The Cost Per Page

Now that we know what to consider before buying toner cartridges, let's tackle how to calculate the cost per page. You can do this by dividing the cost of the cartridge by the number of pages it can print or the page yield. This way, you can see how much you are saving. Here's how to do it:

**Formula:** Cost of the toner cartridge ÷ Page yield = Cost per page

**Example:** 

OEM Samsung MLT-D101S Black Toner Cartridge = $72.99

Page Yield: 1,500

**Therefore:** $72.99 ÷ 1, 500 = 0.04

**Cost per page is 4 cents.**

But wait, there’s more. If you feel the cost per page is still quite expensive, choosing the cheapest toner cartridge while not sacrificing print quality is the best option. CompAndSave’s remanufactured and compatible toner cartridges work just like the original ones at a much lower cost. These products will not disappoint and have a 1-year 100% satisfaction guarantee. Let us calculate the cost per page of CompAndSave’s compatible toner cartridge.

**Example:** 

[Compatible Samsung MLT-D101S Black Toner Cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/samsung/mlt-d101s-toner-cartridge-101s-black?queryID=f38d712e2669039c2f45e10d8867db39&objectID=9198&indexName=magento2_cas_en_products) = $27.99

Page Yield: 1,500

**Therefore:** $27.99 ÷ 1, 500 = 0.01866

**Cost per page is 1.87 cents.**

You can see how big you can save with compatible or remanufactured toner cartridges. There is no need to worry about the quality since it is designed to work just like the original ones.

## Which Printer Toner Is The Cheapest: OEM vs. Compatible vs. Remanufactured

There are several types of toner that you can use for your printer. The first one is OEM cartridges, which stand for original equipment manufacturers. These types of printer toner are genuine or original ones made by the printer company solely for their printers. However, they can be a bit pricey since these companies level the cost of their printers by selling expensive ink or toner.

The other types are remanufactured or compatible toner cartridges. Remanufactured toners are cartridges that are cleaned and inspected thoroughly before being refilled with powder. Compatible toner cartridges, on the other hand, are brand-new and produced by a third-party company. Both remanufactured and compatible cartridges are made to work just like the original, but they are less expensive.
