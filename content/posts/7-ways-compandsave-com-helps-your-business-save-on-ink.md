### Compatible and re-manufactured cartridges save you up to 80%

The fact is that printer manufacturers make most of their money not from selling printers, but from selling [ink and toner cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/). Since this is the recurring cost, this is what manufacturers choose to put a higher sticker price on.

However, when you shop at CompAndSave.com, you never have to pay the exorbitant prices that original equipment manufacturers charge. You may save anywhere up to 80% on your printing needs. Take a peek at our [**Comparison Table**](https://www.compandsave.com/ink-cartridges-price-comparison) to see how much you end up saving.
