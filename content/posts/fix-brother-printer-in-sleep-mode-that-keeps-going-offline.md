Nothing's more annoying than a printer that naps when you need it to work.
Many users get stuck when their Brother printer in sleep mode refuses to wake up, and suddenly, the [printer won’t print,](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/printer-wont-print-tips-to-fix-the-problem-easily.html) no matter how many times you try. It’s frustrating, especially when deadlines are tight, and your device acts like it’s in hibernation.

Brother printers are designed to save energy with Sleep and Deep Sleep Mode, but these features can sometimes backfire. Instead of waking up with a new print job, the printer stays offline, stuck, or unresponsive. If your Brother printer goes offline in sleep mode after being idle, there are ways to bring it back.

**In this article, you’ll learn:**

* What Causes Brother Printer in Deep Sleep Mode Problems
* Steps to Disable the Brother Printer's Deep Sleep Mode
* Pro Tips to Stop Your Printer from Going to Sleep Again

## **Why Your Brother Printer Gets Stuck in Sleep or Deep Sleep Mode**

If your mode isn't responding, you're not alone. Many users experience this with their Brother printer in deep sleep, even though everything appears connected. These energy-saving modes are meant to help, but when they glitch, they can stop your workflow entirely.

### **Purpose of Sleep and Deep Sleep Modes: Save Energy During Inactivity**

Brother printers use sleep and deep sleep modes to reduce power usage when idle. After a certain period of no activity, the printer automatically enters these modes to conserve energy. This function is built into most Brother models, including the HL and MFC series.

* **Sleep Mode:** The printer remains partially active and can quickly wake when a job arrives.
* **Deep Sleep Mode:** The device powers down more deeply, saving more energy but taking longer to wake, or failing to wake entirely.

### **What Triggers These Modes?**

Your Brother printer keeps going to sleep due to preset idle times. These are usually set in the printer's menu or software. If you don’t change them, the printer will sleep after minutes of no activity. On some models, network issues or firmware delays can also cause the device to shift into deep sleep mode prematurely.

**Triggers include:**

* No print activity for several minutes.
* The default power-saving settings have not been customized.
* Wi-Fi dropouts or IP address conflicts.
* Outdated firmware

## **Quick Fixes: Wake Up a Brother Printer in Sleep Mode**

A Brother printer in sleep mode often stops responding when idle for too long. This is meant to save energy, but when your printer won’t print, it becomes a real problem. Here are quick fixes to bring your printer back online and resume printing fast:

### **1. Press the Wake or Power Button**

Tap the Power, Go, or Cancel button on your printer. This usually wakes it instantly. For touchscreen models, just tap the screen. This is the easiest fix when the Brother printer's sleep mode won’t print after being idle.

### **2. Cancel and Resend the Print Job**

Go to your computer’s print queue, cancel the stuck job, then resend it. This helps when your Brother printer goes to sleep and won't print, and jobs get stuck. Send a printer test page to confirm it's working.

### **3. Check the Printer Screen**

Look for any error messages like:

* Reconnect to the network
* Paper jam
* Low toner

Clearing these alerts helps wake up your Brother printer from deep sleep mode.

### **4. Check Power and Connections**

Make sure the printer is plugged in, switched on, and not connected to a dead outlet or turned-off power strip. Also, check if it's in a power save or error state, which can make the [printer offline](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-printer-offline-problem-guide-2024-compandsave.html).

## **Step-by-Step: How to Adjust the Brother Printer in Deep Sleep Mode**

If your Brother printer in sleep mode stops printing or goes offline after being idle, you're not alone. This common issue is often caused by default power-saving settings. Thankfully, most Brother models let you adjust or disable these features. Here's how to fix and prevent your Brother printer in deep sleep mode from causing further disruptions.
