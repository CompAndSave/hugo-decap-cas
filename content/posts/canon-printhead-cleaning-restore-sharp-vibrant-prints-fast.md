First, [what is a printhead](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/what-is-a-printhead-troubleshooting-clogs-and-more-2025.html)? A printhead sprays tiny ink droplets onto paper to create images and text. Its nozzles ensure precise ink placement. Clogged nozzles cause faded, streaky, or incomplete prints. Keeping nozzles clean is key to consistent print quality and effective Canon printer clean print head maintenance.

* **Integrated Printheads:** These are built into the cartridge itself. When you replace an integrated cartridge, the printhead is replaced at the same time. This type is easier to maintain since replacing the cartridge automatically restores print quality.
