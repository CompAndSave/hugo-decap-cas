Statistics show that one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point in their lifetime; which is the most common type cancer diagnosed in women. This disease is the second leading cause of cancer death in US women. Since this is an issue that affects all of us, this October we are working with the National Breast Cancer FoundationÂ® to help make a difference in the fight against breast cancer.

According to experts, early detection is still the best and most effective defense against this disease. When breast cancer is found early, in the localized stage, the 5 year survival rate is 98%. The best ways to be proactive are self breast exams, clinical exams with your doctors, your clinical breast exams and mammograms based on your age and health history.

The best way to fight breast cancer is to have a plan that helps you detect the disease in its early stages. Create your Early Detection Plan at www.earlydetectionplan.org to receive reminders to do breast self-exams, and schedule your clinical breast exams and mammograms based on your age and health history.
