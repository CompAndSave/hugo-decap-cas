## Affordable Printer Ink Cartridges: Tips to Prolong Life

Making sure your printer ink lasts longer is important for saving money and being efficient. Whether you use compatible, remanufactured, or refillable cartridges, these useful tips will help your affordable ink cartridges last longer and get the most out of your printing.

Regular printing helps maintain your cartridges.

### 2. Keep Your Printer Clean

Keep your printer environment clean. Dust and debris can build up over time and affect cartridge performance. Regularly clean your printer, including the paper path and cartridge area, to prevent particles from interfering with the cartridges. A clean printer ensures good performance and makes your cartridges last longer.

### 3. Store Cartridges Properly

If you have extra cartridges, [store them correctly](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-store-printer-ink-cartridges). Keep cartridges in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
