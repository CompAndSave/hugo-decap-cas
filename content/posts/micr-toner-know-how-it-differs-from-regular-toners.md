Do you know how a MICR toner differs from a regular laser toner? Magnetic Ink Character Recognition, or [MICR](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/micr-what-it-is-and-how-it-works.html), is used in banking and finance to process checks and other financial documents such as deposit slips. This technology relies on special MICR toner cartridges to print these documents. But how does it work? In this guide, we'll explore the key differences between MICR toner cartridges and regular laser toners. By the end, you'll understand why MICR toner cartridges are essential for printing checks and other important financial documents. So, let's dive in and uncover the unique features of MICR toner cartridges!

**In this guide, we will discuss:**

* MICR Toner: What Is This?
* MICR Toner Cartridges: How It Differs From Regular Laser Toners?
* MICR Toner Printer: Compatible Models

## MICR Toner: What Is This?

MICR, which stands for Magnetic Ink Character Recognition, is a technology used by banks to process checks. It allows machines to read special characters printed with magnetic ink on the bottom of checks, also known as the MICR line. These characters include bank account numbers, check numbers and routing numbers.

### So, what is a MICR toner?

**MICR toner is a unique substance used to print these magnetic characters.** It contains iron oxide particles, which make the printed characters magnetic. This is important because banks use machines with magnetic sensors, known as [MICR readers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/micr-readers-understanding-how-it-reads-magnetic-ink-characters.html), to read the characters quickly and accurately during check processing.

## MICR Toner Cartridges: How It Differs From Regular Laser Toners?

Now that we understand what MICR toner is, let's see how it's different from the regular laser toner we often use in printers. Although both help with printing, they have some significant differences. Here are some:

### 1. Magnetic Properties

MICR toner contains iron oxide particles, making the printed characters magnetic. This enables them to be read accurately by MICR readers used in banking. Additionally, this magnetic feature prevents fraud. On the other hand, regular laser toner contains synthetic materials, color pigments, and other additives, but it doesn't have anything magnetic like MICR toner does. This makes regular toner less safe and easier to alter.

### 2. Follow Set Standards

MICR toner cartridges are made to follow strict rules set by ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and ABA (American Bankers Association) for accuracy and safety when printing money papers, making sure the printed numbers are easy for MICR machines to read. A regular toner doesn't follow these rules.

For example, MICR toners [use special fonts](<https://www.mekorma.com/resources/blog/details/micr-fonts-in-business-central-difference-between-e13b-and-cmc7#:~:text=MICR%20(or%20magnetic%20ink%20character,the%20world%3A%20E13B%20and%20CMC7.>) to print important numbers on checks, such as the bank routing, account, and check numbers: E-13B, an older one with round characters, and CMC-7, a newer one that looks like barcodes. E-13B has 14 characters and is common in the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK. CMC-7 has 15 characters and is used more in Europe and South America, but it might take scanners a bit longer to read compared to E-13B.

### 3. Specialized Use

MICR toner is mainly used for printing checks and other financial documents because it has special magnetic properties that help banks read the characters easily. If you print checks using regular toner instead of MICR toner, it might not be as easy for banks to read the characters on the checks. This could cause problems with processing the checks, leading to errors or delays in your banking transactions. Regular toner is only used for everyday printing tasks like documents, photos, and other materials.

### 4. More Durable

MICR toner is designed to endure the rough handling of financial papers, ensuring the printing stays clear and readable for a long time. In contrast, regular laser toner may not be as durable and could smudge or fade over time.
