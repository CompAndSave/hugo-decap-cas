## Best Home Office Printer: Steps in Choosing

When choosing your best home office printer, there are some things you need to consider. By looking at different things, you can find a printer that not only does what you need but also makes your home office work easier. So, let's talk about three important steps to pick the right printer:

### Step 1: Figure Out What You'll Print

Take a moment and consider what kind of stuff you'll be printing. 

* Is it mostly regular documents, colorful pictures, or a mix of both?
* How often will you be using the printer? Are you printing a few pages here and there, or are you planning to print a lot regularly?
* Do you need to make copies, scan documents, or send faxes?

### Step 2: Pick the Right Kind of Printer

The next thing you need to do is to [choose the right printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-choose-a-printer-tips-on-selecting-the-best-one-for-you.html) for home office. But with many printers available in the market, how do you pick the one that suits your needs and budget? Let's [compare inkjet and laser printers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-inkjet-printers.html) to help you decide.

**Inkjet Printers**

These are good for nice-looking photos and handling different types of documents. It is actually a good investment to buy a cheap home office printer for home use, but sometimes, the ink can cost more in the long run. But the good thing is, you can also choose a [refillable inkjet printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/best-refillable-inkjet-printer-our-top-4-picks.html) to save on ink.

Not only that! There are also third-party companies, such as [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/), that offer alternative options to save money on ink, such as compatible and remanufactured ink cartridges. [Compatible ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/) are made by third-party companies and are cheaper than the original ones made by printer manufacturers. On the other hand, [remanufactured ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/what-are-remanufactured-ink-cartridges-guide) are used cartridges that are carefully disassembled, cleaned, and checked for any problems. If they find any issues, they fix or change them before filling it up with ink. This saves a lot of money because they don't have to make new cartridge casings. Both of these options are cheaper but still give good-quality prints.

**Laser Printers**

Laser printers are great for printing lots of black and white pages quickly and without costing too much per page. While they might be a bit more expensive to buy initially, they can save you money in the long run, especially if you print a lot. Instead of ink, they use toner cartridges, which can last longer.

If you want to save even more money, you can check out compatible or remanufactured toner cartridges. These options help you keep the benefits of a laser printer for home use without spending too much on new cartridges. Understanding what you need and picking the right printer and cartridges can make a big difference in how much you spend on printing.

### Step 3: Consider the Cost

Besides the printer's initial cost, look at the ongoing expenses like ink or toner cartridges, paper, and any other things you might need. Check [how much it costs to print each page](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-calculate-printing-cost-per-page). Sometimes, printers that are cheaper upfront are more expensive in the long run because of [expensive ink](https://www.compandsave.com/why-printer-ink-is-so-expensive-guide).
