**Struggling to figure out how to print black and white only?**

Dealing with a printer that refuses to print in black and white when your color cartridge runs out can be incredibly frustrating.

This issue can waste time and increase costs by forcing users to replace color cartridges they don’t need. Fortunately, several workarounds and printer settings can help you bypass this problem and help [reduce printing costs](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-reduce-printing-costs).

## Why You Can’t Print Black and White by Default

Printing in black and white only helps you save on expensive color ink, especially for everyday documents. It’s faster and more efficient, allowing you to avoid [printing mistakes](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/top-10-tips-on-how-to-save-on-printer-ink.html) and do the job with less hassle. Plus, it keeps your color cartridges from running out too quickly, giving you more control over printing costs. However, many printer users find it frustrating how to get printer to print black only when the color cartridge is low or empty for some reason. Let’s take a look at the most likely factors.

### 1. Color Fusion for Enhanced Quality

Printers often mix color ink with black to produce richer tones and enhance the overall print quality, even for black-and-white documents. This helps achieve smoother gradients and sharper details.

### 2. Cartridge Health Protection

The printer may stop printing to prevent damage to the empty or low color cartridge, as running a dry cartridge can lead to clogging or permanent damage. Halting the printing process helps extend the lifespan of the cartridge and ensures consistent print quality.

### 3. Manufacturer Revenue Design

Printer manufacturers may design their devices to require all cartridges to function, potentially driving sales of color ink even when it seems unnecessary. This strategy ensures that users regularly purchase replacement cartridges, which can be a significant revenue source for the company beyond the initial printer sale.

## How to Print Black and White Only: Easy Workarounds

After understanding why your printer refuses to print black and white when color ink is low, this section provides simple workarounds to go over it.

### \#1 Adjust Print Settings to Black Ink Only or Mono

Even if your color cartridges are nearly empty, you can still learn how to print just black and white. Many printers allow you to bypass color ink usage entirely, especially when printing text documents. Here's how to get your printer to print black only:

**STEP 1:** Access Printer Preferences: Before starting a print job, go to your printer settings.

**STEP 2:** Select Grayscale or Monochrome: Look for the "Color Settings" and choose either grayscale or black and white. This setting tells the printer to use black ink exclusively.

**STEP 3:** Override Color Warnings: Some printers may stop printing if color ink is low. In such cases, there are often settings to force black-only printing or disable the color ink requirement.

#### **A.) How to Print Black Only on Windows?**

For Windows users, configuring your printer to print black and white only is simple. Follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Open Printer Preferences: Click on the Start menu and go to Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners.

**Step 2:** Select Your Printer: From the list, choose the printer you want to configure and click Manage.

**Step 3:** Access Color Settings: In the printer's preferences, find the Color or Quality tab.

**Step 4:** Choose Grayscale: Under Color Settings, select Grayscale or Monochrome to print black only.

#### **B.) How to Print only Black and White on macOS?**

On a Mac, printing in black and white is just as easy:

**Step 1:** Open the Document: Access the document you want to print, and from the menu, select File > Print.

**Step 2:** Choose Black and White: In the print menu, find the color options and select Black & White or Grayscale.

**Step 3:** Print Using Preview: You can also open the document in Preview, select File > Print, and choose grayscale or monochrome from the color options.

### \#2 Remove or Replace the Empty Color Cartridge

For some printers, all cartridges are mandatory, even if you want to print black only. If you're facing this limitation, consider these options:

#### **1. Replacing the Empty Cartridge**

If you’re willing to buy a new color cartridge, this is the simplest solution. Once replaced, your printer should recognize that all cartridges are full and allow you to print in black and white without issues.

#### **2: Removing the Color Cartridge**

If you prefer a more adventurous route, try removing the empty color cartridge. Some printers will continue functioning with only the black cartridge. Here’s how:

**Step 1:** Turn off the printer and open the cartridge compartment.

**Step 2:** Remove the empty color cartridge.

**Step 3:** Close the compartment and power the printer back on.

**Step 4:** Set the printer to “Black Ink Only” mode using previously discussed methods.

### \#3 Disable Ink Monitoring in the Printer Settings

Another method to force your printer to print with just the black cartridge is by disabling ink monitoring. Many printers stop working when they detect low ink levels, but if you're looking how to print black and white only, you can often turn off this feature:

**Step 1:** Open your printer’s software on your computer (accessible via Control Panel on Windows or System Preferences on Mac).

**Step 2:** Look for options related to Ink Levels or Cartridge Monitoring.

**Step 3:** Disable this feature to stop the printer from checking ink levels.

**Step 4:** Set your printer to use only the black ink cartridge and attempt printing again.

**NOTE:** *This method may vary by printer model, so check your manual for specific instructions*.

### \#4 Switch to Draft or Economy Mode

If you’re still unable to print, try using Draft Mode or Economy Mode. These settings reduce the amount of ink used and might allow printing with just black ink:

**Step 1:** Open your document and go to the print settings.

**Step 2:** Look for options like Quality, Resolution, or Print Mode.

**Step 3:** Select Draft or Economy mode.

While print quality may be lower, this option can be handy when you need to print quickly and don’t require high-quality output.

### \#5 Opt for a Laser Printer

Laser printers use toner, which typically allows them to print black and white documents even when the color toner is empty. This makes them an excellent choice for those who frequently need to know how to print only black. Although this option might not provide an immediate solution, investing in a laser printer can save you money and frustration in the long run.
