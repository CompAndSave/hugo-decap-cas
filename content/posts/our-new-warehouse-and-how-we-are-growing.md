| Our new warehouse and headquarters in San Fransisco Bay Area, CA. |

When we first started CompandSave seven years ago we knew that we wanted our business to find its home in the state of California. It was our goal to become the biggest ink supplier in our market. However, we decide that starting our business in Portland, OR was our best bet for getting the operation up and running. We came to this decision after reviewing the different tax rates for businesses in each state. The seven years we spent in Portland gave us great financial power, the opportunity to lead sales in North America for printer supplies. Even though we were happy and doing well in Portland we still had it in our hearts to move our business to California. We felt that the move would bring us one step closer to reaching our long term goals and give us even more strength in this industry.

We decided to settle in the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area is the best place for CompandSave logistic-wise and also because it is full of companies currently driving the technology world. Joining this community puts us in a position to be the first to hear of and adopt changes in technology that affect our business.

It has only been a couple of months since we made our move to the Bay Area, but the positive effects are already visible. Our warehouse is larger which allows us to increase the size of our staff and keep over 100,000 ink cartridges in stock. In our industry having a fast product cycle and being able to serve customers quickly is very important. Our new facility allows us to do just that. We have a dynamic team, and we are eager to become one of the largest online retailers in our industry. Such motivation and positive impacts as a result of logistic advantages, will most likely cause a trigger effect and exceeds our expectations in terms of a quicker growth.
