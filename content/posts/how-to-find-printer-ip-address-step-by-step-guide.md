If you’re here, you’ve probably run into one of the most common printing headaches: not knowing the IP address on printer. Without it, setting up your printer on a network or [troubleshooting connection issues](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-printer-offline-problem-guide-2024-compandsave.html) can feel impossible.

You’re not alone in this. Many home users and office workers struggle with how to find printer IP address because:

* Printer menus vary widely by brand and model
* Instructions online are inconsistent or too technical
* You don’t know where to look on your device or computer

You want a straightforward, no-nonsense solution to get your printer up and running quickly. That’s exactly what you’ll find in this guide.

## **What Is a Printer IP Address and Why Does It Matter?**

First, let’s break down the basics: What is an IP address on a printer?

An IP address is a unique set of numbers assigned to devices on a network, kind of like a mailing address, but for internet or network devices. Your printer’s IP address allows your computer, phone, or tablet to find and communicate with your printer over Wi-Fi or wired networks.

If you don’t know what the IP address of your printer is, you’ll face issues like:

* Inability to add the printer to new devices
* Difficulty accessing printer settings remotely
* Frequent print job failures due to network conflicts

In other words, knowing your printer’s IP address is crucial for smooth, reliable printing, especially if you share your printer with multiple devices or use it in a business setting.

## **How to Find Printer IP Address: Your Go-To Methods for Any Printer**

There are several ways to find your IP printer address, depending on the model and the devices you have available. We’ll cover the most common, reliable methods so you can pick what works best for you.

### **Method 1: Find Printer IP Address Directly on Your Printer’s Display**

If your printer has a built-in screen or control panel, this is usually the fastest way to get your printer IP address:

* Navigate to Settings, Network Settings, or Wireless Settings on your printer’s menu.
* Look for a section labeled Network Configuration, Wi-Fi Status, TCP/IP Settings, or Network Info.
* The IP address should be clearly displayed as a series of numbers separated by dots (for example, 192.168.1.45).

**Brand-Specific Tips:**

* **HP Printer IP Address:** On most HP models, go to Wireless > Wireless Settings > IP Address or Network Setup > View Wireless Details.
* **Canon Printer IP Address:** On Canon printers, head to Setup > Device Settings > LAN Settings > Confirm IP Address.

This method helps you get your printer's IP address directly from the source without requiring any other device or network access. It’s usually quick and accurate.

### **Method 2: Print a Network Configuration or Status Page from Your Printer**

If your printer doesn’t have a screen or the menu is confusing, you can print a network status page that lists all important network information, including your IP address.

Here’s how to find the IP address on printer easily:

* **HP Printers:** Press the Wireless or Information button, or go into the Settings menu and select Print Network Configuration or Wireless Network Test Report.
* **Canon Printers:** Use the Setup button, navigate to Printer Settings, then select Print LAN Details or Network Status.
* **Other Brands:** Look for options like Print Network Report, Configuration Page, or Network Status Page.

This printout will show your printer IP address, subnet mask, gateway, and other network info. It’s easy to do, doesn’t require a computer, and provides detailed information useful for troubleshooting or network setup.

### **Method 3: Find Printer IP Address on Your Computer**

If your printer is already installed and working on your computer, you can find the IP address through your operating system.

**On Windows:**

* Open the Control Panel and go to Devices and Printers.
* Right-click your printer and choose Properties or Printer Properties.
* Select the Ports tab. You should see your printer’s IP address listed next to the selected port (usually labeled “Standard TCP/IP Port”).

Alternatively, on Windows 10 or 11:

* Open Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners.
* Select your printer and click Manage.
* Click Printer Properties, then the Ports tab.

**On macOS:**

* Go to System Preferences > Printers & Scanners.
* Select your printer from the list.
* Click Options & Supplies, then check under General or Location. Your printer IP address may be listed there.

If your printer is already connected, this is a quick way to get the IP address without needing to print anything or access the printer’s physical menu.

### **Method 4: Check Your Router’s Connected Devices List**

Your network router keeps track of all devices connected to your home or office Wi-Fi. You can log into your router’s admin interface to find your printer’s IP address.

Here’s how:

* Open a web browser on a device connected to your network.
* Type your router’s IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) into the address bar and press Enter.
* Log in with your router’s username and password (often found on the back of the router or in your ISP’s documentation).
* Navigate to Connected Devices, Device List, DHCP Clients, or a similar section.
* Look for your printer’s name or MAC address in the list. Its IP address will be shown alongside.

This method on how to find printer IP address is handy if your printer isn’t responding or you can’t access it directly. It shows all devices on your network, helping you confirm your printer’s network presence and IP address.

## **Bonus: What to Do When Your Printer IP Address Keeps Changing**

One frustrating issue you might encounter is your printer’s IP address changing every time you restart your router or printer. This can cause connection failures on your computers and devices.

To avoid this:

### **Assign a Static IP Address to Your Printer**

A static IP means your printer keeps the same address all the time. You can usually set this either:

* **On your printer:** Check your printer’s network settings for an option to set a manual IP address.
* **On your router:** Use your router’s DHCP reservation feature to assign a permanent IP to your printer’s MAC address.

Setting a static IP saves you the hassle of hunting down the IP address every time something changes.

## **Wrapping It Up: You Can Find Your Printer IP Address With Confidence**

When you know how to find printer IP address, it puts you in control of your printing setup. Whether you’re trying to add your printer to a new device, troubleshoot connection issues, or just want peace of mind, the steps above will guide you through the process.

Remember, the IP address on printer is your printer’s unique identifier on your network. Finding it might seem tricky at first, but with these easy methods like checking the printer display, printing a network report, using your computer, or looking at your router, you’ll have it in hand quickly.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **What if I can’t find my printer IP address anywhere?**

Make sure your printer is connected to the network and powered on. Try restarting both the printer and your router to refresh the network connection. If your printer only supports USB connections, it might not have an IP address.

### **Is the IP address the same as the MAC address?**

No. The MAC address is a unique hardware identifier, while the IP address is assigned by the network. Both can help identify your printer, but the IP address is used for network communication.

### **How do I assign a static IP address to my printer?**

You can assign a static IP either directly through your printer’s network settings menu or by logging into your router’s admin panel and reserving an IP address for your printer’s MAC address. This ensures your printer keeps the same IP address every time it connects.
