## **Important Factors When Picking Top Rated Home Printers**

Choosing the best home printers means finding reliable models that fits your space, budget, and tasks. Demand for top rated home printers has led brands to offer smart features, high performance, and value. Buyers now expect multifunction devices with speed, quality, and easy connectivity.

### **1. Inkjet vs. Laser Printer**

One of the biggest decisions when buying the best printer for your home is to choose between an [inkjet vs. laser printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/inkjet-vs-laser-printer.html).

* **Inkjet** printers are ideal for photos and colour documents. They’re best for occasional use and are generally more compact.
* **Laser** printers excel at fast, high-volume black-and-white printing. They have a higher upfront cost but lower running costs over time.

### **2. Print Quality: DPI, Text Sharpness, Photo Clarity**

For home users, clear text and vivid images matter.

* Look for at least 600 x 600 DPI for documents.
* For photo prints, 1200 x 2400 DPI is ideal.

### **3. Printing Speed and Duty Cycle**

Speed matters if you print frequently.

* Entry-level printers offer 8–12 ppm (pages per minute).
* Heavy-duty models reach 25–30 ppm.
* Also, check the duty cycle—the number of pages a printer can handle monthly.

### **4. Running Cost: Ink vs. Toner, Page Yield**

Always check the long-term cost.

* Ink costs more over time and may dry out.
* Toner lasts longer and reduces cost per page.

For budget-friendly options, go for a [printer with cheapest ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/best-printer-with-cheap-ink-cartridges-our-top-5-picks.html) or models with XL ink tanks. Some [top printers without subscriptions](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/5-best-home-printer-2024-top-rated-non-subscription-printer.html) now include refillable ink systems—cutting ongoing costs significantly.

### **5. Connectivity: USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cloud Print**

Modern top rated home printers should connect effortlessly.

* Wi-Fi enables wireless printing from laptops and phones.
* Bluetooth allows fast, direct pairing.
* Cloud services (like Google Cloud Print, Apple AirPrint) offer remote access.

### **6. Functions: Print, Copy, Scan, Fax (All-in-One)**

All-in-One printers are popular among the top printers for home use. They combine multiple features in one unit:

* Print
* Scan
* Copy
* Fax (rarely used, but included in some models)

### **7. Paper Size Support and Input Capacity**

Most home printers support A4, A5, and photo sizes.
Check the input tray size:

* Small trays (60–100 sheets) suit light users.
* Larger trays (200+ sheets) are better for frequent use. Photo printers may also support specialty paper formats.

### **8. Size, Noise Level, and Design**

Space is limited in most homes.

* Go for compact, low-noise models.
* Sleek, minimal designs blend with interiors. Many best home printers today are designed to be unobtrusive and desk-friendly.

### **9. App Integration and Mobile Printing**

Apps simplify everything.

* Look for support with HP Smart, Canon PRINT, or Epson Smart Panel.
* Mobile printing lets you send files from anywhere.

It depends on what you print. In the [inkjet vs. laser printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/inkjet-vs-laser-printer.html) debate, laser printers are better for fast, high-volume black-and-white documents.
