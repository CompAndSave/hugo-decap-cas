If your printer keeps going offline, refuses to print, or suddenly cannot connect to your network, the issue often comes down to the IP address on printer devices. Small business owners and home office users know the frustration: your printer works one moment, then after a router restart or network change, it disappears. You waste time reconnecting it on every computer, lose productivity, and deal with constant interruptions.

The solution? Understanding your IP printer address and knowing how to set, change, or assign a static IP to your printer. This guide walks you through everything, step by step, for Windows and macOS, so you can maintain a stable connection and print without interruption. If you need to locate your printer’s IP first, check out our detailed guide on [How to Find Printer IP Address](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-find-printer-ip-address-step-by-step-guide.html).

## **What Is an IP Address on a Printer and Why It Matters**

An IP address is like the home address of your printer on your network. It tells your computers, laptops, and other devices where to find it so they can send print jobs. Without a stable IP, your printer can:

* Go offline after a router restart
* Stop being recognized by computers
* Cause endless reconnection headaches

Most modern printers obtain an IP address automatically via DHCP, but dynamic IP addresses can change. That’s why learning how to set printer IP address or assign a static IP is crucial for uninterrupted printing.

## **How to Find Your Printer IP Address**

Before changing or assigning a new IP, you need to know your printer’s current address. Here’s [how to find printer IP address](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-find-printer-ip-address-step-by-step-guide.html) on Windows and Mac:

#### **On Windows**

* Open Control Panel → Devices and Printers.
* Right-click your printer → Properties.
* Select the Ports tab.
* Look for the IP address listed under the port your printer uses.

#### **On Mac**

* Open System Preferences → Printers & Scanners.
* Select your printer → Options & Supplies.
* Check the Location or IP tab for the current IP.

#### **On the Printer Itself**

Most printers have a display or web interface:

* Check Network Settings or Wi-Fi/Network menu.
* Print a network configuration page, which usually lists the IP address.

## **Why Your Printer IP Address Changes**

Printers often use dynamic IP addresses by default. Your router assigns a new IP via DHCP, which can change after:

* Router or modem restarts
* Network updates or changes
* Long periods of inactivity

When the IP address on printer changes, your computers might no longer recognize the printer, resulting in frustrating “offline” messages. Assigning a static IP address or reserving one on your router is the easiest way to avoid these interruptions.

## **How to Set a Static IP for Your Printer**

A static IP gives your printer a fixed address that won’t change, ensuring consistent connectivity. You have two main options:

### **Method 1: Reserve IP on Your Router (Recommended)**

* Log in to your router admin panel (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1).
* Find DHCP reservation or Static IP assignment.
* Select your printer from the connected devices list.
* Assign an IP outside the normal DHCP range to avoid conflicts.
* Save changes and restart the printer.

### **Method 2: Set Static IP on the Printer Manually**

* Access your printer’s control panel or web interface.
* Navigate to Network Settings → IP Settings.
* Select Manual or Static IP.
* Enter the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway (usually your router’s IP).
* Save changes and reboot.

**Tips:**

* Use an IP address such as 192.168.1.50 (check your network range).
* Ensure no other device uses the same IP.

Setting a static IP can eliminate random disconnections and save you from repeated troubleshooting.

## **How to Change the IP Address on a Printer**

Sometimes you may need to change printer ip address, such as when:

* Another device is using the same IP
* You’ve moved your printer to a new network
* You’re reorganizing your network addresses

### **Windows**

* Open Control Panel → Devices and Printers.
* Right-click your printer → Printer Properties → Ports tab.
* Click Configure Port.
* Enter the new IP address and save.

### **Mac**

* Open System Preferences → Printers & Scanners.
* Select your printer → Options & Supplies → Location/IP.
* Enter the new IP and save.
* Reconnect all computers to the updated IP address.

## **Configuring Printer IP for Multiple Devices**

Once you’ve set or changed your IP printer address, make sure every device on your network can access it:

1. Update the printer on each computer:
2. * **Windows:** Control Panel → Devices and Printers → Add a printer using the new IP.

   * **Mac:** System Preferences → Printers & Scanners → Add printer via IP.
3. Test printing from each device to confirm the connection.
4. Document your IP addresses for easier troubleshooting in the future.

By taking these steps, you’ll avoid the frustration of devices failing to find the printer.

## **Common Printer IP Issues and How to Fix Them**

Even with a static IP for printer, you might run into a few issues. Here’s how to handle them smoothly:

* **Printer appears offline:** Ensure the IP is outside the DHCP range or reserved in your router.
* **Cannot print from some computers:** Remove the printer and re-add it using the new IP.
* **IP conflict with another device:** Change the printer to an unused IP within your network range.
* **Wireless drops:** Move the printer closer to the router or switch to a wired connection.

Taking a proactive approach can prevent unnecessary downtime and lost productivity.

## **Advanced Tips for Businesses and Home Offices**

For offices or homes with multiple devices, keeping your printers connected reliably is essential:

* Document all printer IP addresses to keep your network organized.
* Use DHCP reservation rather than manual static IPs for easier management.
* Check printer IPs regularly to prevent surprises before they impact productivity.
* Use network scanning tools like Advanced IP Scanner to detect all printer addresses on your network.

These small steps can prevent major headaches, especially in busy work environments.

## **Why a Stable Printer IP Matters**

A printer that repeatedly loses connection can cost time, money, and productivity. Reconnecting printers across multiple devices wastes hours and interrupts workflow.

By setting a static IP address, your printer stays online, devices connect reliably, and printing runs smoothly every day. Whether you’re running a small business or working from home, this simple step ensures your office stays efficient and frustration-free.

## **Final Thoughts**

If your printer keeps going offline or causing disruptions, chances are it’s an IP address on printer problem. Understanding and managing your IP printer address, whether by assigning a static IP or reserving one through your router, ensures reliable connectivity and stress-free printing. Take a few minutes to set this up today and enjoy uninterrupted printing for all your devices.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

### **Can all printers use a static IP?**

Yes. Most modern printers, including HP, Canon, Brother, and Epson, support static IP assignment either through their control panel or web interface. Using a static IP ensures your printer stays connected to your network consistently, so you don’t have to constantly troubleshoot connection issues or worry about your printer IP address changing unexpectedly.

### **My printer IP keeps changing. What’s the quickest fix?**

The fastest way to stop your printer’s IP from changing is to reserve it in your router settings. By creating a DHCP reservation for your printer, it will always receive the same IP printer address automatically. This prevents random offline errors, keeps all your devices connected, and saves time spent reconfiguring the printer on multiple computers.

### **How do I choose an IP range for a static IP?**

To avoid conflicts, first check your router’s DHCP range—for example, 192.168.1.2–192.168.1.100. Pick a number outside this range for your printer, such as 192.168.1.150. Assigning a static IP within this range ensures your IP address on printer remains unique, preventing other devices from accidentally using the same address.

### **Can multiple computers print to one IP printer?**

Yes. Once your printer has a static IP address, all devices on your network can connect to it using that address. This is especially useful in small businesses or home offices, where multiple computers need to send print jobs to the same printer without constant reconfiguration. Make sure the IP printer address is configured correctly on each device.
