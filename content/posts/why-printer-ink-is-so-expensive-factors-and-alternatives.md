## How Expensive is Ink: Costs and Comparison

[Research by Consumer Report](https://www.consumerreports.org/printers/the-high-cost-of-wasted-printer-ink/) shared that even the cheapest OEM printer ink cartridges cost $13 per ounce, while the most expensive ones can go up to $75 per ounce.



In comparison to other commodities, printer ink is still relatively expensive. Imagine you want to buy a pound of your favorite coffee beans. You'd pay around $1.92 for that. Now, a pound is equal to 16 ounces. So, for just one ounce of printer ink, it could cost you $13. Multiply that by 16, and it becomes $208 â€“ that's more than eight (8) times the cost of a pound of coffee beans!



Even paper, something we often use with ink, is much more reasonably priced. A stack of 500 sheets costs about $8. Even the cheapest printer cartridge at $13 can only print around 250 pages, which is only half of that paper stack.

Why Is Ink So Expensive: The Cost Factors

Printer ink stands among the priciest liquids on the market, even surpassing the cost of high-end wines. So why is printer ink so pricey? Let's delve into the six main reasons why printer ink is so expensive.



## Sourcing Costs:

Printer ink and toner are made up of complex formulations and high-quality pigments that can be expensive to source. The manufacturing process requires precision and quality control to ensure consistent results, which adds to the overall cost of production. These pigments and formulations can be sourced from specialty suppliers worldwide, adding to printer ink and toner costs.

* **Business Profitability:**

Printer manufacturers often sell their printers at relatively low prices or even at a loss, aiming to compensate for the loss by selling ink and toner cartridges. This business model, known as the "razor and blades" model, allows manufacturers to generate ongoing revenue through ink sales. Therefore, the higher prices of ink and toner cartridges contribute to the profitability of printer manufacturers.

* **Availability of Ink/Toner:**

Printer manufacturers often design their printers to work exclusively with specific ink cartridges. This practice, known as "vendor lock-in," restricts consumers from using third-party or generic ink cartridges. As a result, manufacturers monopolize the ink market for their specific printer models, allowing them to set higher prices.

* **Research and Development:**

Ink technology constantly evolves to improve print quality, longevity, and resistance to fading. Printer manufacturers invest significant resources in research and development to develop new ink formulations and technologies. These costs are then passed over to consumers through higher ink prices.

* **Supply and Demand:**

Printer ink is in high demand due to the widespread use of printers in homes, businesses, and educational institutions. The high demand, coupled with limited competition in the market, allows manufacturers to maintain higher prices. The complex manufacturing processes and the limited number of suppliers can also lead to supply chain constraints, further driving up prices.

* **Environmental Regulations:**

Printer ink contains chemical compounds that need to comply with various environmental regulations, such as restrictions on hazardous substances. Meeting these regulations requires additional research, testing, and compliance processes, which increase the production costs of ink and, subsequently, the retail price.
