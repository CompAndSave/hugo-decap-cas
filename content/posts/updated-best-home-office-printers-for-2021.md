As more people began to work at home, the need for home printers rose. A home printer should match your printing needs.

How to Choose a Home Office Printer

**Inkjet vs Laser**. A home office printer can be an **inkjet** or a **laser** printer. Inkjet is great for those who would like to print their own photos aside from documents. Laser printers are great for those who have a big print load.

**Printer Resolution**. For users who will print mostly documents with graphics, 300 dpi (dots per inch) is acceptable. For crisp, professional documents, 600 dpi will enhance the print. 1200 dpi is often used for photo printing. But for professional photographs, printers with a resolution of 2880 by 1440 is sought after. 

## How We Have Chosen our Recommendations

In choosing our recommended home office printers for 2021, we only included those that have the following:

**Multi-Function Printer (MFP)**. A home office printer will need to be a multi-function printer that can also **scan**, **copy** and **fax**. This way, the home office will not be cluttered with other appliances.

**Paper Saver**. As home printer users tend to want to save money when printing drafts, we also only included printers with **auto duplex printing** or **2-sided printing**.

**Connection**. For convenience, a home printer must be able to print through **wireless** and **USB** connection. Connections through USB and **Ethernet** create faster printing. While wireless connection creates the convenience of **mobile printing**.

**Low Cost Consideration**. Lastly, a home office printer's expense in its lifespan must be considered. A printer can be cheap but its ink expenses could hurt your wallet in the long run. Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xIvj92CMVnK4zLQLcJuKGDyicF3oNybjnQFQbnIevN4/edit?usp=sharing) to know how we considered the lifespan expense or Cost Consideration of each printer.
