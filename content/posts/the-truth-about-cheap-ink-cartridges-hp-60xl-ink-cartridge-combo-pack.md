Are you looking for cheap ink cartridge of some companies, for instance, [HP 60XL Ink Cartridge Combo Pack](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/60xl-ink-cartridges/cc641wn-cc644wn-2-combo) or HP 60XL Ink Cartridge? HP offers these products for a certain price. You can find the actual price of these products from the company's website.

If you search further on the Internet, you can find that many other websites offer the same products for much less a price. How does it happen â€“ others selling a particular product at a lower price than the actual manufacturer? This post unravels the mystery.

**Ultimate truth**

First, let us get a popular myth out of the way. You do not get the original product sold at the website of the original manufacturers or authorized sales centers at a reduced rate unless there is some kind of special offer or discount coupon. Large companies take into account their operating costs and advertising expenses in addition to the actual manufacturing costs when pricing a product.

The OEM (original equipment manufacturer) cost of HP 60XL Ink Cartridge Combo Pack or HP 60XL Ink Cartridge cannot be much lower than that listed on the corporate website of HP.

Then how do some websites offer genuine [HP 60XL Ink Cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/60xl-ink-cartridges/cc641wn-cc644wn-2-combo) Combo Pack and HP 60XL Ink Cartridge products at half the original prices? It must be one of the following options: reworked cartridges and compatible versions.

**Reworked versions**

Companies take once-used OEM cartridge and rework it to make it as good as the brand-new OEM cartridge. They clean the nozzles of print head several times and refill the ink in the same procedure and methodology as the original manufacturer does. The composition and material of the ink is same as that of the original ink.

In the case of HP 60XL Ink Cartridge Combo Pack or HP 60XL Ink Cartridge, the company uses a particular type of pigment-based ink. It provides high print quality like all pigment-based inks do, but dries quickly as dye-based inks do. The ink pressure level and the electrical circuitry are kept the same as the original cartridge. That means you have a reworked cartridge as fresh and good as original cartridge at almost half the price.

**Compatible versions**

Some companies manufacture a fresh cartridge exactly the same way the original manufacturer does it. They get the production manual from the original manufacturers and proceed to make a compatible version that is as good as the original. Such models also provide excellent price discounts to the buyers.

**Stay away from duplicates**

A third type is also available; these are either plain cheap duplicates or old re-used models of original cartridge. Buyers should stay away from these products as the only benefit it offers is the initial cost advantage. These products break down almost instantly, causing a great deal of inconvenience and frustration.

**How can one distinguish from reworked products from duplicates?** 

There are websites that specialize in selling reworked and compatible versions. It is better and safer to buy HP 60XL Ink Cartridge Combo Pack and HP 60XL Ink Cartridge from such websites. You will get both product quality and cost-effectiveness.
