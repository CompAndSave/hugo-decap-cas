* Stitched Photo Art \- Does your mom have a favorite photo? Did you take a recent photo of a grandchild that would make a grandma beam with pride? Why not print the photo out in black and white and then add pops of color by stitching yarn or embroidery fabric throughout the photograph? Purchase or recycle an old frame and you are good to go! This is a unique twist on the typical framed photograph gift!
