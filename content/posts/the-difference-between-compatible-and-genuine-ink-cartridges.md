There are now many different types of Ink Cartridge that we can purchase for our Printers. The one in which we decide to buy can largely come down to how expensive they are and the quality of the ink that it is used. When we look through the market today, we have the genuine models, the Refill method, the remanufactured types and also the Compatible ink cartridges. All methods will claim that the Ink used is of the highest quality, and that the final results of the printer, will be far superior to that of others.

With all the variety to choose from how do we know which cartridges will be the best for us to use, in our family households. The use of our printer has no doubt become more and more over the years, many people now work from home, and our children seem to have many reasons, to use our valuable ink. Ink cartridges can be expensive and can be a royal pain, when the time comes to replace them.

However knowing the correct places to look, will enable us to get through this ordeal, without a great cost, and still being able to achieve the results that we look for, from our printers. 

Compatible Ink cartridges are taking the market by storm and the quality they can produce is on par with the genuine brands if not better. The problem we have, is that these genuine high name brands will only recommend that we use their own ink cartridges, of course they would do this, as it is all business. The problem comes with the amount of money they charge for their [ink cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/), and even at the lowest price range, they are still a little expensive. 

There is much argument as to the difference in genuine ink cartridges, to compatible ink cartridges. People think that because you pay less money for the compatible ink cartridge, that you will not receive the same service. This is not the case, and the reality Is, that there is no difference in the quality of the cartridge or the ink at all. The only difference that you will find is the price and the name of the actual cartridge. 

Many people are now realising this, and are seeking the services of compatible ink cartridges. Take a look for yourself and see the amount of money you can save, when you purchase the correct Compatible ink cartridge for your Printer.
