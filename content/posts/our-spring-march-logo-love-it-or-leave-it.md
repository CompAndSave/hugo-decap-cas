Spring is here. It's a time of change, Spring Break vacations, spring cleaning, beautiful scenery, and...a logo change.

...And it's a cute logo change if we do say ourselves. We asked our awesome designers to come up with a March company logo that had a "Spring" feeling to it. Just take a quick peak and you'll see what we are talking about, or look down below:

### CompAndSave's March Logo Change 

We like changing up things for you guys. If you remember from last month in February, we also changed our logo in honor of American Heart Month with hearts. For March, we outfitted our logo with a colorful butterfly and grass to capture the spirit of spring. Do you think we did a good job of it?
