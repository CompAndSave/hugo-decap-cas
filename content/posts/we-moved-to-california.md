Comp and Save would like to officially announce the relocation of our company. Previously we resided in Portland, OR and have now moved to San Francisco, CA area. While leaving Portland was hard for us after being located there since our start, we felt it was time to make the move to California. 

  
We want to assure our faithful customers as well as our new customers that this move will not affect the quality of service you will receive from us. CompAndSave will continue to purchase directly from manufacturers at high volumes, locking in steep discounts. Our inventory is for sale exclusively online, keeping our business overhead to a bare minimum. We pass all to the savings on to our customers and are able to sell ink cartridges at cheap and affordable prices. 

  
We ship our printer ink cartridges and laser toner cartridges orders by US Priority Mail and FedEx. Orders placed before 4PM EST will be shipped out the same business day. Free shipping is available for all U.S. orders over $50, otherwise $3.99 low flat-rate shipping cost will be added.

  
We are very excited about our new office and warehouse. We are still working on some minor details but will post pictures of our new facility in the near future.
