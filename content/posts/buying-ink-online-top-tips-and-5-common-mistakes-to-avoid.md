## How to Buy Printer Cartridges Online?

### Types of Cartridges Available: OEM vs. Aftermarket

When you purchase ink cartridges online, you’ll encounter two main types:

1. **OEM Cartridges (Original Equipment Manufacturer)** are produced by the printer manufacturer. They offer reliable quality but can be pricier.
2. **Aftermarket Cartridges** are made by third-party companies. They often provide affordable printer ink and toner options. If sourced from reputable brands, they can match OEM quality. Under this category, you’ll find two common types:

   * **Remanufactured Cartridges** are recycled OEM cartridges that have been cleaned, refilled, and tested for reuse. They can save money and are eco-friendly, but quality varies by supplier.
   * **Compatible Cartridges** are new cartridges built by third-party manufacturers to work with your printer. When sourced from reputable companies, they offer print quality comparable to OEMs at a fraction of the cost.

Now that we know these options, let’s discuss the DOs and DON’Ts when you buy ink cartridges online. Master these, and you’ll do just fine, and SAVE BIG!
