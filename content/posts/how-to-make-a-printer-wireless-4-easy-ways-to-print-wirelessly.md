Have you ever wondered how to make a printer wireless? 

Printing technology has evolved to offer unmatched convenience and flexibility. This has enabled users to print from various devices, including smartphones and tablets. Knowing how to make a wired printer wireless can enhance productivity and streamline workflows. 

**This guide explores:**

* The Types of Wireless Printing 
* Benefits of Wireless Printing
* How to Make a Printer Wireless
* Resolving Wireless Printing Issues

## Wireless Printing and its Types

Wireless printing allows you to send print jobs to a printer without a direct physical connection, like a USB cable. This can be achieved through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Infrared (IrDA).

### 1.  Wi-Fi Printers

These connect to your home or office network, allowing multiple devices, including computers, smartphones, and tablets, to send print jobs. To [connect the printer to wifi](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-connect-printer-to-wifi), access the printer's network settings and follow the prompts.

### 2. Bluetooth Printers

These use short-range wireless technology to connect directly to nearby devices like laptops or smartphones. Ideal for quick, localized printing, they lack the broader connectivity range of Wi-Fi printers.

### 3. Infrared (IrDA) Connections

This less common method uses light waves to transmit data between devices. The printer and the sending device must be close and aligned correctly, making it slower and less reliable than Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

## Advantages of Wireless Printers

Wireless printers offer unmatched convenience and flexibility, supporting multiple devices and making them ideal for home and office environments. Here are some advantages of wireless printers over wired printers.

### 1. Convenience and Flexibility

Learning how to make a printer wireless offers significant convenience. You can place the printer anywhere within your Wi-Fi network range, freeing up desk space and reducing clutter.

### 2. Multi-Device Support

Wireless printers allow multiple devices, including desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets, to print simultaneously, making them ideal for homes and offices.

### 3. Mobile Printing

Easily [print from Android phones](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-print-from-android-phone), iPhones, or iPads, catering to the increasing use of mobile devices for everyday tasks.

### 4. Cloud Printing

Many wireless printers support [cloud printing](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/ultimate-guide-to-cloud-printing-cloud-ready-printers-2024.html), enabling direct printing from cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox, eliminating the need to download files to your computer first.

### 5. Cost-Effective

Upgrading a wired printer to wireless, using methods like linking it to a router, utilizing a print server, or adding the Bluetooth adapter, is often more cost-effective than buying a new wireless printer.

## How to Make a Printer Wireless?

This section explores how to make a wired printer wireless using methods like routers, guiding you through the process of enabling printing from computers, iPhones, iPads, and Android phones. Four main methods on how to make wired printer into wireless include:

* Using a Router

**5. Install Printer Drivers -** Download and install the necessary drivers on your computer, ensuring the printer is recognized as a network device.

**b) Ethernet Connection**

**1. Connect via Ethernet -** Link the printer to the router using an Ethernet cable connected to a LAN port.

**2. Power On and Configure -** Turn on both devices and ensure the router recognizes and assigns the printer an IP address.

**3. Configure on Printer -** Navigate through the printer’s menu to confirm network connection and settings.

**4. Network Access -** Install the printer drivers on all network devices and connect them using the printer's IP address.

### Method 2: Using a Print Server

A print server is an efficient way to make a wired printer wireless, allowing multiple computers on the same network to access it wirelessly.

**1. Setup Connection**

* Confirm the print server's compatibility with your printer.
* Connect the print server to the printer using a USB or Ethernet cable.
* Link the print server to your router wirelessly or via Ethernet cable.

**2. Install Software**

* Install the software from the print server's installation CD or download it from the manufacturer’s website.
* Follow the installation wizard to set up the print server.

**3. Configure Print Server**

* Open a web browser and navigate to the print server's IP address.
* Enter your network’s SSID and password to [connect printer to wifi](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-connect-printer-to-wifi) network.
* Set a static IP address for the print server to ensure stable connectivity.
* Conduct a test print to verify that the print server and printer are properly connected and accessible from all network devices.

### Method 3: Using a Bluetooth Adapter

A Bluetooth adapter can make a wired printer wireless, enabling print jobs without a Wi-Fi network.

**1. Choose Bluetooth Adapter**

* Ensure the Bluetooth adapter is compatible with your printer.
