These laser printers rely on compatible toners cartridges to finish print functions whether they are black and white, or perhaps of the colour variety. Precisely how long many of these toner cartridges last, genuinely depends on the size of the actual compatible toner cartridges, the style of the particular printing device, and the print settings along with pre-set's integrated into the printer. 

Whatever the conditions, a number of these toner cartridges, will eventually deplete as they continue to be used on a daily basis.
