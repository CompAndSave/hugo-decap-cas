Watching your hard-earned money disappear into [expensive printer ink](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/why-printer-ink-is-so-expensive-factors-and-alternatives.html) is frustrating, mainly when you rely on your printer for daily tasks. 

However, there are effective ways to save on ink cartridges without sacrificing quality. CompAndSave deals allow you to access high-quality compatible and remanufactured cartridges that deliver exceptional performance at a fraction of the cost of OEM products.

## The Truth About OEM Ink Cartridges Costs

OEM ink cartridges are notably overpriced, making it challenging to [save on printer cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-save-on-ink-cartridges-6-smart-ways-to-save-money.html). But what drives the cost of these cartridges so high?

* Limited Competition: OEMs use chip technology to block [third-party cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/truth-behind-third-party-ink-cartridges-cheaper-alternative.html), limiting competition and forcing consumers to purchase overpriced branded options.
