When it comes to having an office for a small business, design and layout are critically important. Work environment can influence employee productivity, morale and retention rates. In fact, a [study](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&ved=0CEsQFjAD&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.team-mates.com%2Fstorage%2Fknowledge-center-documents%2FGensler%2520U.S.%2520Workplace%2520Survey%2520-%2520DesignPerformanceIndex.pdf&ei=wY3kUJumI-aTiALMg4FY&usg=AFQjCNHG53JCpgrTakFcrN5W%5FGAnXs21uQ&sig2=4w3jbpKm9h7HeP18x9Cr3g) done by architecture firm [Gensler](https://www.gensler.com/) said that only 50 percent of current employees believe their office inspires innovation and creativity.

A pleasant, well-organized office space has clear benefits for a small business, such as ease of workflow, a [professional appearance](https://www.maintenance-one.com/blog/benefits-of-a-clean-office/), and even healthier workers. Unfortunately, not many small businesses can afford the services of a professional designer. But have no fear! Composing an effective, efficient office space is easy, and can easily be done within a small business itself.

**What makes a small business environment work?**

There are many factors to consider when redesigning or even cleaning just up a small business office. Here are a few of the most important:

**Comfort.** Above all, you should strive to create a comfortable work environment for your employees. Ergonomic work chairs, natural lighting and even [a pleasant color scheme](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/best-colors-for-your-office-products-and-packaging%5Fn%5F1640420) go a long way to establish a productive environment. It's also important to choose an image that tells visitors exactly what the company's all about. Not sure where to start? The images at the [Office Design Gallery](https://www.officedesigngallery.com/) can help inspire the right office aesthetic for your company brand and culture. And of course, your own employees are great resources for ideas and input.

**Efficiency.** The office should be organized to fulfill specific objectives efficiently. Define the top three to five objectives of each department of your small business and organize their space around making those objectives easier to achieve. This could mean grouping collaborative teams together, placing equipment and supplies where they are most often needed, and creating a logical flow through the office space that allows for quick communication. The office should have a designated meeting space and printing station with a stocked [office supply](https://www.compandsave.com/) closet.

**Budget.** As with everything in small business, budget matters. If you cannot make all the changes you would like today, plan your office changes in waves that align with cash flow. For very small businesses, this estimate may be a bit high. Consider cutting costs by buying or renting used furniture and doing easier tasks yourself, such as painting walls.

An efficient office is key for running a successful small business. In order to keep running efficiently, it's important for a small business to have a well-organized space. So that's our New Year's goal for this year!
