If you use a printer scanner regularly, you know how convenient it is to quickly digitize documents for work, school, or personal projects. But when your printer scanner not working correctly, it can throw a wrench in your plans and leave you feeling stuck. Your scanner may not respond, produce blurry images, or display confusing error messages. Whatever the issue, it disrupts your workflow and can be surprisingly stressful.

The good news is that many [common printer problems](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-common-printer-problems-tips-for-easy-troubleshooting.html) have straightforward fixes. In this guide, we’ll walk you through simple troubleshooting steps to get your scanner up and running quickly. By the end, you’ll feel confident tackling scanner issues and keeping your digital tasks moving smoothly.

## **Why Is My Printer Scanner Not Working?**

Before we dive into the fixes, it’s helpful to understand why your printer scanner might not be working as expected. Common reasons include:

* **Connection issues:** Your computer may not recognize the scanner due to USB or network problems.
* **Driver problems:** Outdated or corrupt drivers can cause your scanner to malfunction.
* **Hardware faults:** Internal scanner components may be malfunctioning or require maintenance.
* **Software conflicts:** Conflicting software or incorrect settings can prevent scanning.
* **Compatibility issues:** Especially common if you use third-party software or older printers.
* **Power management settings:** Sometimes, USB ports on your computer are set to power-saving mode, which can cause intermittent disconnections or failure to recognize the printer scanner. Checking your computer’s power settings and disabling USB selective suspend can help prevent this.

Now, let’s explore how to fix common issues in scanners, including an HP printer scanner not working, so you can digitize your documents easily again.

## **Step 1: Check Your Printer Scanner Connections**

Many scanner problems start with connection issues. Here’s what to do:

### **Wired connections**

* Ensure the USB cable is securely connected to both your printer scanner and computer.
* Try unplugging and plugging the USB cable into a different port.
* Use a different USB cable, if available, to rule out a cable fault.

### **Wireless connections**

* Check that your printer scanner and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
* Restart your router and printer to reset network settings.
* Use your printer’s control panel to print a network status report and confirm connectivity.

## **Step 2: Restart Devices and Software**

A simple restart can fix many temporary glitches.

* Turn off your printer scanner and unplug it.
* Restart your computer.
* Power on the printer scanner again.
* Relaunch your scanning software or app.

If you’re using Windows, try restarting the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service, which handles scanner communication. You can do this by:

1. Press Windows + R, type services.msc, and press Enter.
2. Find Windows Image Acquisition (WIA), right-click it, and select Restart.

This quick reset often clears scanner detection issues.

## **Step 3: Update or Reinstall Printer Scanner Drivers**

Outdated or corrupt drivers cause many printer scanner not working problems.

### **How to update drivers:**

* Visit your printer manufacturer’s official website (HP, Brother, Epson, etc.).
* Download the latest scanner or all-in-one printer drivers for your model.
* Install the updated drivers and restart your computer.

### **How to reinstall drivers:**

* Open Device Manager (Windows + X > Device Manager).
* Find your scanner or printer under Imaging devices or Printers.
* Right-click and select Uninstall device.
* Restart your computer, and Windows should reinstall the drivers automatically.

For a Brother scanner not working or a similar printer, driver updates usually fix compatibility and recognition issues.

## **Step 4: Check and Configure Scanner Settings**

Incorrect settings can cause scans to fail or produce poor-quality results.

* Open your scanning software or app (e.g., HP Scan, Windows Fax and Scan, Brother Control Center).
* Ensure the correct scanner device is selected if you have multiple devices installed.
* Select appropriate scan settings, such as resolution, color mode, and file format.
* Try scanning a test document with default settings to rule out setting-related issues.

If your scans are blurry or faded, reducing the scan resolution or cleaning the scanner glass can help.

## **Step 5: Clear Scanner Hardware Issues**

Sometimes, hardware problems cause your printer scanner to malfunction.

* Check the scanner glass for dust, fingerprints, or smudges, and clean it gently with a microfiber cloth and glass cleaner.
* Inspect the scanner lid to ensure it closes properly and presses the document flat against the glass.
* Listen for unusual noises during scanning, which could indicate mechanical faults requiring professional service.

If your scanner has a printer scanner problem that persists after troubleshooting, contacting customer support or a technician may be necessary.

## **Step 6: Use the Troubleshooter Tools**

Both Windows and macOS have built-in tools to diagnose and fix scanner problems.

### **Windows:**

* Go to Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.
* Select Printer or Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.
* Follow the prompts to detect and resolve issues.

### **macOS:**

* Open Image Capture app to check if your scanner is detected.
* Run Apple Diagnostics if you suspect hardware issues.

These tools can save time by automating common fixes.

## **Step 7: Check for Software Conflicts**

Other software can sometimes interfere with scanner operation.

* Close any other applications that may be using the scanner or printer.
* Temporarily disable the antivirus or firewall to determine whether they block scanner communication.
* Uninstall any recently added software that could conflict with scanning.

If disabling software fixes the problem, add exceptions for your scanning apps in security settings.

## **Step 8: Try an Alternative Scanning Method**

If your usual scanning software isn’t working, try another method.

* Use the built-in Windows Fax and Scan app or Windows Scan from the Microsoft Store.
* On macOS, use Preview to scan documents.
* Use your printer manufacturer’s mobile app if your device supports smartphone scanning.

Alternative apps can bypass software bugs and help you scan successfully.

## **Step 9: Update Your Operating System**

Sometimes, system updates include important fixes for hardware compatibility.

* Check for and install the latest updates on Windows or macOS.
* Restart your computer after updating.

Keeping your OS current can prevent many device recognition problems.

## **Step 10: Reset Your Printer Scanner to Factory Settings**

If all else fails, resetting the printer scanner to factory defaults can clear persistent errors.

* Use your printer’s control panel menu to find the reset or restore option.
* Follow manufacturer instructions carefully.
* Reconfigure network settings and reinstall drivers as needed.

This step often resolves stubborn scanner issues, but should be used as a last resort.

## **Bonus Tips for Better Printer Scanner Performance**

Even after fixing common issues, there are simple steps you can take to keep your printer scanner running smoothly and extend its lifespan. These bonus tips will help you improve scan quality, prevent problems before they start, and make your scanning experience faster and more reliable.

* Always scan documents on a clean, flat glass surface to avoid shadows or smudges.
* Use high-quality scanning software recommended by your printer brand.
* Regularly update drivers and firmware to maintain compatibility.
* Avoid scanning thick or glossy materials, as they can cause [paper jams](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-paper-jam-in-printer-reasons-and-solutions.html) or poor results.
* If you often scan documents in bulk, consider using a dedicated document feeder if your printer supports it. This can save time and reduce wear on the flatbed scanner glass.
* Calibrate your scanner occasionally, especially for color-sensitive scans, to improve accuracy. Some scanners include built-in calibration utilities, or you can use third-party calibration software.

## **Final Thoughts**

A printer scanner not working can disrupt your day, but most scanner issues are easier to fix than you think. With a little know-how and the right steps, you can get your printer scanner back to working smoothly and keep your tasks on track.

## **Frequently Asked Questions** 

### **Why does my printer scanner not work even though the printer prints fine?**

Printing and scanning rely on different hardware and software components inside your device. Even if your printer prints, the scanner may fail if its drivers or software are outdated or corrupted. Updating or reinstalling scanner drivers often resolves this issue.

### **How do I fix HP scanner not working on Windows 10?**

Start by updating or reinstalling the HP scanning drivers from the official website. Restart the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) service, which manages scanner communication. Also, check your USB or network connections and run the HP Print and Scan Doctor tool for automated troubleshooting.
