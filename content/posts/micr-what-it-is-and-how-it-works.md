## MICR: What Does It Mean?

{{< youtubeLazyload id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SIQpqwwoe4" title="What is MICR? And how does it work?" >}}

Magnetic Ink Character Recognition, also known as MICR line and read as “micker,” is a strip of characters found at the bottom left of a check. This includes essential information about the bank account and the check itself. The American Bankers Association (ABA) created this technology in the late 1950s to help machines read checks faster and more accurately. The characters are printed using magnetic ink or [MICR toner](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/micr-toner-know-how-it-differs-from-regular-toners.html), such as [HP 26X MICR toner cartridge](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/26x-micr-toner-cartridge-cf226x-black), so machines can easily recognize even if marks or signatures are on the check. 

### So, what are some of its components?

[![MICR check](/blog/images/ingoude.-2024-03-29t211917.354.png "bank check")](/blog/images/ingoude.-2024-03-29t211917.354.png)

**1. Routing Number**

The routing number is like a bank's ID number, helping to show which bank the check belongs to. It's nine digits long and is assigned based on the state where the bank is located. 

**2. Account Number**

Account numbers usually have 8 to 12 digits, but some can be as long as 17 digits. Each checking account has its unique number. It also tells the bank which accounts the money should come from or go into. So, every check for a specific account at a bank will have the same account number.

**3. Check Number**

The check number is a short code, usually three or four digits, that helps identify each check within a series. It's usually found at the top right corner of the check. Sometimes, banks might switch the account order and check numbers, but they're both there to help keep track of your checks.

Additionally, four special symbols separate the banking, routing, and account numbers on checks. These symbols are called Transit, Amount, On-Us, and Dash. They help mark where the bank code, customer account number, transaction amount, and parts of the routing or account numbers begin and end.

## Magnetic Ink Character: How Can It Be Read?

MICR can be read using machines called [MICR readers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/micr-readers-understanding-how-it-reads-magnetic-ink-characters.html). This magnetic ink character reader is used to sort, process, and check the validity of checks. When a document, such as a check, is scanned, [MICR readers use a magnetic sensor called the MICR head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rHgSEmt2Is) to detect the magnetic ink and read the MICR characters. Each number has its own pattern, which the machine matches to the correct digit. But, these machines need to be fed checks at a steady speed. If it's too fast or slow, the numbers printed using MICR magnetic ink might not be read correctly.  So basically, MICR readers make sure checks are authentic and help banks handle them correctly.

## Magnetic Ink Character Recognition: Advantages and Disadvantages

Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) is essential for banks because it helps process checks quickly and keeps our money safe. But, like anything, there are good and not-so-good sides to it. Let's look at the advantages and disadvantages of MICR to understand how it affects banking.

### Advantages

**1. Keeps Checks Safe**

In banking, keeping checks safe is important, and MICR plays a significant role in achieving this. It uses special fonts and magnetic ink that are hard to copy or change, making it tough for [fraudsters to alter or fake checks](https://www.alogent.com/blog/check-fraud-common-examples-and-how-stay-ahead-fraudsters#:~:text=Altered%20check%20fraud%20occurs%20when,accounts%20from%20different%20financial%20institutions.). If someone tries to cash a fake check with a photocopied MICR line, the bank teller will know it's fake right away using the MICR reader. This helps protect your money and keeps your transactions secure.

**2. Speeds up Check Processing**

MICR technology speeds up check processing by using special magnetic ink that machines can read fast. This helps banks and businesses handle lots of checks quickly and efficiently. So, you don't have to wait as long for your transactions to go through, making your financial tasks easier and faster.

**3. Makes Things Consistent**

MICR is used worldwide to process checks, ensuring they all follow the same rules and designs. It keeps checks consistent in how they're designed and coded, helping different systems work together, and lower mistakes. This makes it easier for banks and businesses to operate smoothly, as they can trust that checks will be handled the same way everywhere.

### Disadvantages

**1. Can be Costly**

Using MICR technology can cost a lot because it needs special ink and printing, which can make running banks and other financial places more expensive. The good thing is, there are cheap MICR toners that you can use in printing. 

**2. Limited Characters**

MICR can only read certain letters and symbols, so it can only be used for certain kinds of papers and transactions.

**3. Environmental Impact**

Making and throwing away toner cartridges for MICR can harm the environment, adding to electronic waste and pollution if not handled carefully. But, there are ways you can [recycle cartridges](https://www.compandsave.com/where-to-recycle-ink-cartridges-guide).

## MICR Printing: Things You Need For Printing

Printing checks with MICR technology requires some items to ensure accuracy and meet banking standards. These include special fonts, magnetic toner, printer, and specific paper. Let's see what each of these does to help make checks that are secure and hard to change.

### 1. MICR Fonts

You need a set of MICR fonts that meet ANSI and ABA banking standards. These fonts ensure that the characters on the checks are encoded correctly and comply with banking regulations.

[![micr fonts](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-03-29-at-3.37.42 pm.png "E-13B font")](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-03-29-at-3.37.42 pm.png)
