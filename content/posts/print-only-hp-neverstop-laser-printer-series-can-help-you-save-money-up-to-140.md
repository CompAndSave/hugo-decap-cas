The HP Neverstop Laser Printer allows for fast reload of toner and heavy print loads. It's perfect for users who have to print more than 500 pages a month.

  
It is also said to save to up to 80% in HP toner. According to our calculations and comparisons, it can save up to 140% in its 5-year average lifespan.

## Calculating the Cost of Ownership

A printer can be priced cheap but rack up expenses in its lifespan. 

Similar to what we have used to comparing the most [Ink-Efficient Inkjet Printers](https://medium.com/compandsave/6-most-ink-efficient-inkjet-printers-for-home-office-this-2020-8c9398bbf337), we used this formula:

  
(Cost per Page x Yearly Printload x Years of Ownership) + Printer Price = Cost Consideration

Cost per Page is Toner Price divided by Toner Page Yield.

  
Yearly Printload is 8,400 pages for the average high printload is 700 pages per month.

  
Years of Ownership is [5 years](https://yourbusiness.azcentral.com/life-span-laser-printer-11859.html) for that is the average lifespan of laser printers.

## Calculating Duration of Inbox Yield of the Printer

Just like what we did when we [compared Epson EcoTanks with HP Instant Ink](https://medium.com/compandsave/updated-epson-ecotank-printer-vs-hp-instant-ink-what-brands-dont-want-you-to-know-1c95050652d6), we also considered the toner that comes with the Neverstop Laser Printers aka the Inbox Yield.

  
For example, [HP Neverstop Laser 1000a](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html) comes with the Inbox Yield of 5,000 pages. This means that the toner that comes with the model would last for 7 months for users with a high monthly printload of 700 pages.

  
By considering the duration of its Inbox Yield, we only need to calculate 53 months in its Cost Consideration instead of 60 months or 5 years.

## Print-Only HP Neverstop Laser Printers

There are two HP Neverstop Laser Printers that only have the Print function (without Copy or Scan function included).

[HP Neverstop Laser 1000a](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/mlp/laserjet) only has a Hi-Speed USB 2.0 port. While [HP Neverstop Laser 1000w](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/mlp/laserjet) has a USB connection, a wireless feature and has a mobile printing capability.

  
We will compare HP Neverstop Laser 1000a first with other HP Printers and Brother printers with the similar features.

## Improving Your Buying Decisions

The HP Neverstop Laser Printer Series can help people save money in the long run despite being comparably expensive from other laser printers. However, page yield may vary depending on the user. This is because the page yields determined by printer manufacturers are based on ISO/IEC 19752 and continuous printing.

  
For example, some Amazon reviewers have complained that HP Neverstop Laser 1000w only prints up to 1,000 pages only. ([1](https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3QYX8J9PML73O/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Farp%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SVPQX49), [2](https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1BZKOMHXKRXZI/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Fgetr%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SVPQX49), [3](https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R366PIWZV6E7WC/ref=cm%5Fcr%5Fgetr%5Fd%5Frvw%5Fttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07SVPQX49))
