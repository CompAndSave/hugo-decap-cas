## What is a Toner?

Toner is a powder used in laser printers and photocopiers to create text and images on paper. The printer uses it by melting the powder onto the paper to create the final print. The toner is kept in a toner cartridge. These cartridges last around 18-24 months and can print about 2,000 pages before you need a new one. It is also available in different colors for color printing.

### So, what is the drum on a Brother printer?

[![Drum on a Brother printer](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-2.44.32 pm.png)](/blog/images/screenshot-2024-07-02-at-2.44.32 pm.png)

Laser printers only work if you have a drum unit installed. In contrast to the toner cartridge, the drum unit aids in transferring the toner powder onto the paper to produce images and text. Drum units and toner cartridges can be sold together or separately. Drums last longer, usually replaced after using 3-4 toner cartridges. Saving money is easy because you don't have to buy both the toner and drum unit every time you run out of toner. If you see streaks, smudges, printing problems, or strange sounds, it's time to replace the drum unit, even if you just changed the toner.
