Before the Easter bunny delivers the Easter candy, have your kids join in the Easter fun. They can color printables, create crafts, and play Easter-inspired games. Let's hop down the bunny trail and explore some fun and free Easter DIY projects for you to do with your children.  

## Easy Easter DIY Projects

### Printables

[DLTK ](https://www.dltk-holidays.com/easter/printables.html)has a bunch of different printables for you and your children to have fun for hours. Your kids can create bookmarks, cards, and t-shirt designs using our [transfer paper](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/transfer-paper/inkjet). Print [these pages](https://www.dltk-holidays.com/easter/measterposter.htm) in black and white and let your children color in the drawings of bunnies or flowers. With these printables, kids can draw faces on a hatched chick, bunnies, and lambs.

### Crafts

In addition to printables, First Palette has a bunch of craft projects. Most are less than 10 steps. Below are a few of our favorites.

Peep, peep! Baby birds need a home. To build a nest for baby birds, you will need:

* Paper plate or paper bowl
* Brown tempera or poster paint
* Large pompoms
* Wiggle eyes
* Orange craft foam, felt or paper
* White glue
* Safety scissors
* Paint brush
* For nesting material: paper shreds, brown crepe paper, raffia, or natural materials, such as small twigs

A "carrot" cone holder can hold Easter candy and trinkets. Here's what you will need:

* Orange heavy cardstock
* Scissors
* Hole punch
* Tacky glue, white glue, or double-sided tape
* Ribbon or pipe cleaner
* Optional decorative materials, such as lace, [stickers](https://www.compandsave.com/paper/sticker-paper), sequins, or glitter

This hatched chick is too cute. The necessary materials are:

* Cardboard egg carton
* Large yellow pompom
* Yellow feathers
* Orange craft foam, felt, or construction paper
* White or pastel-colored tempera or poster paint
* Wiggle eyes
* White glue
* Safety scissors

You can also craft a cotton bunny and many more charming designs at First Palette.

### Games

Why not check out some of the Easter games we've featured [before](https://blog.compandsave.com/2015/04/easy-steps-to-plan-easter-games-for-kids.html)? Besides the usual Easter egg hunt, swap the donkey for a rabbit in "pin the nose on the bunny." Another fun, simple option is the "jellybean toss" in which kids toss as many jellybeans in a cup within a set time period. Take the fun outside and host an "egg on a spoon race." Kids race to the finish line while balancing an egg on a spoon. Dropped eggs = disqualification. First one to cross the line with the egg intact on the spoon wins!
