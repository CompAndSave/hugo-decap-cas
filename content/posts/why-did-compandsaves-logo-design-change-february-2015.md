Notice something different about our company logo? Over the weekend, the CompAndSave team updated our logo to reflect an important national occurrence in February. In case you were wondering, it's not Valentine's Day.

### CompAndSave Logo Change - February 2015

In honor of American Heart Month, the CompAndSave team has changed our logo design to promote being heart healthy and raise awareness about heart disease to our readers. We recognize every heart is precious, and including it in our company logo represents joining the fight against cardiovascular disease (CVD). 

We wanted to once again do our part this February to fight cardiovascular disease (CVD). Last year, we actually fundraised and donated over $10,000 to the American Heart Association thanks to your help. This company logo design is just another small step toward making a difference.

Let us you know what you think of our new logo design in the comments below!
