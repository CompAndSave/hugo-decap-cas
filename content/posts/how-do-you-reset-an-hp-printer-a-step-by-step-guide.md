For touchscreen models, resetting an HP printer is simple through the printer menu.

**Steps (Touchscreen):**

1. Go to Setup or Settings on the printer display.

**Common sequences include:**

* Hold Wi-Fi + Cancel buttons until lights blink.

* Ensure the printer is not stuck in HP printer offline mode.

For non-touch models, retry the button combination reset, which often serves as a second layer of fix, similar to how to hard reset a HP printer.

If repeated attempts don’t solve the issue, contact HP Support. This is best if:

* Firmware updates fail.
