You press the power button on your Brother printer, waiting for that familiar hum—only nothing happens. No lights, no sound, no response at all. If your Brother printer won’t turn on, it can ruin your whole day, whether you need to print an important work document or a simple school project.

The good news? Most of the time, your printer isn’t beyond fixing. With a few simple [Brother printer troubleshooting](https://www.compandsave.com/brother-printer-troubleshooting-guide) steps, you can often get it working again without spending money on costly repairs or replacements.

In this guide, you’ll discover the most common reasons why a Brother printer not turning on and step-by-step solutions to bring it back to life. So, let’s get started!

## **Why Your Brother Printer Won’t Turn On?**

Knowing why your printer isn’t turning on helps you troubleshoot and resolve the issue more quickly. Brother printers are usually reliable, but like any device, they can have problems due to power surges, worn parts, or software glitches. The most common causes include:

### **1. Loose or Damaged Power Cord**

If the connection isn’t secure or the cord is faulty, your printer simply won’t power on. Check the cord carefully; even a small tear or bent plug can stop your printer from working.

### **2. Faulty Power Outlet**

Sometimes the outlet itself is the problem, not your printer. Try plugging another device into the same socket. If it doesn’t work, you’ll need a different outlet before blaming your printer.

### **3. Internal Hardware Issues**

A blown fuse, damaged circuit board, or other internal fault can prevent your printer from starting. If you notice burnt smells, strange noises, or visible damage, this could be why your printer is not turning on.

### **4. Overheating or Power Surge**

Sudden spikes or drops in electricity can make your printer shut down or fail to start. Using a surge protector can help prevent these issues in the future, saving you both time and stress.

### **5. Firmware or Software Glitches**

Occasionally, your printer may freeze during startup due to outdated firmware or software errors. Keeping your printer’s software up to date ensures it runs smoothly, reducing the likelihood of this issue recurring.

### **6. Environment and Setup Issues**

If your printer shares a crowded power strip with other devices, it may not get enough power to start. Ensure your printer is connected directly to a reliable outlet for optimal results.

By understanding these common causes, you can quickly determine whether it’s something you can fix yourself or if you need professional help, saving you unnecessary stress and expense.

## **Brother Printer Not Turning On: Step-by-Step Fixes** 

You don’t need to be a tech expert to fix it when your Brother printer won’t turn on. By following a few simple, practical steps, you can often get your printer working again, save time, and avoid the stress and cost of professional repairs. 

Let’s start with the easiest solutions and work our way to the more advanced ones:

### **1. Check the Power Cord and Connections**

Before assuming your printer is broken, always check the power cord first—it’s the easiest thing to inspect and often the cause of the issue.

**Step 1:** Unplug the printer from both the power outlet and the printer itself.

**Step 2:** Wait about 30 seconds.

**Step 3:** Plug the power cord back in securely.

**Step 4:** If your Brother printer not turning on, try using a different power cord if you have one available.

**Step 5:** Inspect the cord for tears, frays, or bent plugs.

### **2. Test the Outlet**

Sometimes the issue isn’t the printer—it’s the outlet. Testing the outlet helps you rule out simple electrical issues before proceeding.

**Step 1:** Plug another device (like a lamp or phone charger) into the same outlet. If the device doesn’t work, the outlet may be faulty.

**Step 2:** Move your printer to a different, reliable outlet.

**Step 3:** Test the printer again to see if it powers on.

### **3. Hard Reset the Printer**

If you have a Brother MFC printer, a helpful [video guide from DANDLINC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCoHmnep7Ic) is available to demonstrate the hard reset process. You can follow along visually, or you can check the steps below:

**Step 1:** Unplug the printer from the power outlet.

**Step 2:** While the printer is unplugged, press and hold the power button for 8–10 seconds, then release it.

**Step 3:** Press and hold the power button again, and while keeping it pressed, plug the printer back into the power outlet.

**Step 4:** Continue holding the power button for an additional few seconds until the printer powers on.

**Step 5:** Check the printer screen to confirm it has power and is ready to use.

### **4. Inspect for Damage**

Before assuming a major fault, take a moment to carefully inspect your printer. This step helps you spot obvious problems that you can address or report when contacting support.

**Step 1:** Check the printer for burnt smells, unusual noises, or visible damage near the power area.

**Step 2:** If you notice any of these signs, it may indicate an internal hardware problem.

**Step 3:** Determine whether you can attempt a fix yourself or require professional assistance.

## **When to Get Professional Help**

If none of the above fixes work and your printer not powering on no matter what you try, the issue may be internal. Possible causes include:

* A blown fuse inside the unit
* A damaged power board
* A hardware failure that needs repair

At this point, contacting Brother support or a repair technician is your best option. If your printer is older, it might be worth comparing repair costs with the price of a replacement.

## **Signs It’s Time to Buy a New Printer**

Even with professional help, there are times when replacing your printer is the smarter choice. Look out for these signs:

* Your printer is old and frequently breaks down.
* Repair costs are close to or exceed the price of a new printer.
* It suffers from repeated internal hardware issues.
* You need updated features or better reliability that your current model can’t provide.
* Your printer frequently disrupts your workflow, causing stress or delays.

**Tip:** Investing in a new printer can save time, reduce frustration, and often provide faster performance, updated technology, and a fresh warranty.
