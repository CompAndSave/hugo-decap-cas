## Compare Ink Cartridge Prices For Printers: OEM Vs. Compatible

Before we know what ink is cheaper in this printer ink price comparison guide, let’s first discuss the difference between OEM and compatible ink cartridges. Knowing these differences will help you make a smart choice and save money on your printing.

### What Is An OEM Cartridge?

An OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) cartridge, also known as a “genuine” ink cartridge, is a printer ink cartridge made by the same company that produced your printer. For example, if you have an HP printer, an OEM cartridge would be one made by HP. These cartridges are designed to work perfectly with your specific printer model, ensuring high-quality prints and reliable performance. However, they are often more expensive than other types of cartridges.

They cost more because much research, development, and testing are done in manufacturing. Also, companies often sell printers at low prices and make money by selling these cartridges. This way, you pay less for the printer but spend more on ink cartridges over time.

### What Is A Compatible Cartridge?

A compatible or “generic” cartridge is a printer ink cartridge not made by the original printer manufacturer (OEM) but designed to work with your specific printer model. These cartridges are typically produced by third-party companies, like CompAndSave, and are made to meet or exceed the same quality and performance standards as OEM cartridges.

Compatible cartridges are often less expensive than OEM cartridges because they are produced without the same brand name and associated research and development costs. They offer a more affordable alternative for consumers who want to save money on printing costs while still achieving satisfactory print quality. However, just like the original cartridges, it's important to ensure compatibility with your printer model before purchasing a compatible cartridge to avoid any potential issues.

### Let's look at this sample printer ink comparison to see the difference:

For HP 564XL ink cartridges, a set of 9 packs from the original manufacturer can cost as much as $191.91. In contrast, a compatible set from CompAndSave is priced at $52.11. This means you can save a lot by choosing the compatible option.

Similarly, consider the Brother LC61BK black ink cartridge. The original cartridge sells for $26.99 at Staples, but a compatible ink cartridge from CompAndSave is only $2.99. That's 89% less than the price of the original cartridge.

So, as we compare printer ink prices above, can you see how much you can save when you choose compatible ink cartridges? Choosing compatible cartridges can lead to significant savings without compromising quality!
