## Key Considerations When Buying Best Home Inkjet Printers

When you want the [best printer to buy](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/what-is-the-best-printer-to-buy-tips-before-buying-guide.html) for home use, key factors come into play. Consider your printing habits, such as needing high-quality photos or simply everyday documents.

### 1) Print Quality and Resolution

Print quality is crucial when choosing a good inkjet printer for home use. Prioritize sharp text for document printing and focus on high resolution for photos. Most of the best inkjet printers for home use offer resolutions up to 4800 x 1200 dpi, ensuring impressive detail in both text and images. 

### 2) Printing Speed

Speed is a crucial factor when selecting a good inkjet printer for home use. Look for printers with pages per minute (ppm) ratings: typically, black-and-white prints average 10 to 15 PPM, while color prints range from 5 to 10 ppm. For those who print frequently or in high volumes, opt for models with higher ppm ratings to save time without sacrificing quality.

### 3) Printer Price vs. Ink Costs

Consider the initial and ongoing ink expenses when buying the best home inkjet printers. Low upfront printer prices can result in high long-term costs if ink cartridges are expensive. Frequent printing can further increase these costs, so consider subscription services like HP's Instant Ink or take the refillable tank printers route like Epson's EcoTank.

### 4)  Connectivity and Compatibility

When selecting the best inkjet printers for home use, prioritize models that offer versatile connectivity options like WiFi, Bluetooth, and cloud printing. These features enable seamless printing from smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Additionally, ensure compatibility with various operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and mobile devices, to avoid future issues.

### 5) Paper Handling and Duplex Printing

If you frequently print double-sided documents or use various paper sizes, look for a printer that offers automatic duplex printing and supports multiple paper types and sizes.

### 6) Energy Efficiency and Sustainability

Finally, consider the energy efficiency and sustainability of your printer choice. Many of the best home inkjet printers are designed with eco-friendly features, including energy-saving modes and recyclable cartridges.

## How to Maintain Best Home Inkjet Printers | Helpful Tips

Choosing a reliable inkjet printer for home use is just the start. Consistent maintenance is vital for optimal performance and longevity. Here are key tips to ensure your best at-home inkjet printer pick stays in excellent condition.

**Tip 1: Check Cartridges Regularly:** Inspect your ink cartridges regularly for leaks. If you notice any signs of leakage, replace the cartridge immediately to avoid damaging your printer.

Most printers have a built-in cleaning function—check your manual for instructions on how to use it.

**Tip 4: Follow Manufacturer Instructions:** Always refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for maintenance, cleaning, and replacing parts.
