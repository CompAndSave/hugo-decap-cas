As part of their Breast Cancer Awareness campaign, CompAndSave.com is said to be taking their corporate social responsibility to the next level by dedicating the entire month of October to educate the public on the importance of early detection while supporting those who've been affected by breast cancer.

"This campaign maybe one of the most, if not the most, important campaign we've ever run," said Andrew Yeung, President of CompAndSave.com. "This is critical and we wanted to take a different approach. We want to empower the people affected by breast cancer, in some shape or form. That's why our campaign slogan is **Pink Doesn't Yield, It Survives!"**  
In the effort to provide support and empowerment, CompAndSave.com will not only donate money to NBCF through transactions made on their website, they will also donate $1 for every new "Like" they receive on the [company's Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/compandsave.ink) and for every re-tweet of "Supporting the National Breast Cancer Foundation (R) @compandsave - Pink doesn't yield, #pinksurvives" on Twitter.

Furthermore, with every purchase made worth $50 or more, **customers will receive a free custom designed t-shirt** with the campaign slogan "Pink Doesn't Yield, It Survives"; and they'll **also receive a free custom designed "#PinkSurvives" wristband** regardless of the total amount of their purchase.

"We know that October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, but we don't want to stop there," said Andrew Yeung. "We needed a way to continue bringing awareness and support for those who are affected by breast cancer. That's the purpose of the free t-shirts and wristbands."

[Their ultimate goal](https://www.compandsave.com) is to donate at least $10,000 to NBCF by the end of October and they're using a variety of different online presence to achieve that goal.
