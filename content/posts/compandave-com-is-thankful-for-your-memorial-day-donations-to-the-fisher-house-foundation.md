[![CompAndSave.com Memorial Day Donation Infographic](/blog/images/Snap66.jpg)](https://www.compandsave.com)On May 2014, [CompAndSave.com](https://www.compandsave.com/) took the pledge to never forget our fallen heroes, **in honor of Memorial Day**. Thanks to you and your participation, we **donated over $6,000 to the [Fisher House Foundation](https://www.fisherhouse.org/)** in support of military families all over the U.S. That is a small token of appreciation for the soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. Ultimately, the message is to be forever grateful for their sacrifice by promising to never forget. **Thank you for taking the pledge and contributing to our cause!**
