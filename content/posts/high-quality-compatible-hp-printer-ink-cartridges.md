If you own a HP printer then you will be no stranger to the quality in which they are able to produce. All HP printers are built for durability and to produce quality documents and images, all printers that have been made from HP have been well reviewed and come highly recommended from the general public. Hewlett Packard is now standing at the top of the printing industry and as long as they continue to release high quality printers, then we can expect to see them maintain this superiority.

One range of printers that have been released from HP is the PhotoSmart series. The PhotoSmart range of printers have been around for several years now, and as the name might suggest, they have all been specifically designed and built to be able to produce high quality images. In recent years we have seen a general increase in the amount of people who use their own printers to print images or photographs. Only the latest technology is installed into these printers, and depending on how new the model of printer is that you are looking at is, you may find wireless technology, LCD screens and even internal memory as features on the printer.

If you use your PhotoSmart printer on a regular basis or even if you use your printer as a method to print high quality images, then you will no doubt have to replace your ink cartridges on a frequent basis. You may think that the only option available to you is to buy the expensive genuine ink cartridges, which the manufacturer will say, are the best option for your printer.

When you are printing images you are looking for a printer that will maintain the attention to detail that your camera will have picked up on the original image.
