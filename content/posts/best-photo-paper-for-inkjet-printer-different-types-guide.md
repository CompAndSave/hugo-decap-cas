This special paper is perfect for showing tiny details in your photos. It prints really precisely, so you get clear and sharp pictures.

Inkjet photo paper dries fast because it sucks up the ink quickly. This means your prints won't smudge, and you can enjoy them immediately.

#### **4. Durability**

Photo paper is often more durable than regular printing paper. It is designed to withstand the handling and potential exposure to elements, ensuring that your printed photos last longer and remain in good condition.
