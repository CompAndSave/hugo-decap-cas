## Inkjet Photo Paper: What It Is?

Photo paper is a special paper made for printing pictures from your printer. It's not like regular writing paper. Instead, it's smooth, so the printer ink gets absorbed well, making your pictures look vivid and detailed. You can also pick different finishes, like glossy or matte, to get the look you want for your prints.

### So, why use photo paper to print photos?

#### **1. Vibrant Colors**

Inkjet photo paper is great for making your colors look bright and real. It gives your prints a lively and lifelike appearance.

#### **2. Sharp Details**

This special paper is perfect for showing tiny details in your photos. It prints really precisely, so you get clear and sharp pictures.

#### **3. Quick Drying**

Inkjet photo paper dries fast because it sucks up the ink quickly. This means your prints won't smudge, and you can enjoy them immediately.

#### **4. Durability**

Photo paper is often more durable than regular printing paper. It is designed to withstand the handling and potential exposure to elements, ensuring that your printed photos last longer and remain in good condition.

#### **5. Professional Finish**

Using photo paper makes your prints look really professional and polished. The paper's texture and finish make your photos look super nice, almost like they were made by professionals.

But the tricky part is there are different kinds of photo paper. So, how can we pick what's best for your needs? Let's figure it out!

#### **A. Light Transfer Paper**

This type of transfer paper's material is different from the dark one due to its translucent background, so it is highly recommended to use only on white or very light-colored cotton fabrics like cream, pale shades of pink, pale pastels, and the like, as long as it is not too dark.
