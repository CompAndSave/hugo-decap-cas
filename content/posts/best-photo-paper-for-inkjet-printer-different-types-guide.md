## Inkjet Photo Paper: What It Is?

Photo paper is a special paper made for printing pictures from your printer. It's not like regular writing paper. Instead, it's smooth, so the printer ink gets absorbed well, making your pictures look vivid and detailed. You can also pick different finishes, like glossy or matte, to get the look you want for your prints.

### So, why use photo paper to print photos?

Inkjet photo paper is great for making your colors look bright and real. It gives your prints a lively and lifelike appearance.

#### **2. Sharp Details**

This special paper is perfect for showing tiny details in your photos. It prints really precisely, so you get clear and sharp pictures.

#### **3. Quick Drying**

Inkjet photo paper dries fast because it sucks up the ink quickly. This means your prints won't smudge, and you can enjoy them immediately.

#### **4. Durability**

Photo paper is often more durable than regular printing paper. It is designed to withstand the handling and potential exposure to elements, ensuring that your printed photos last longer and remain in good condition.

#### **5. Professional Finish**

Using photo paper makes your prints look really professional and polished. The paper's texture and finish make your photos look super nice, almost like they were made by professionals.

### 2. Transferable Paper

Iron-on transferable paper transfers texts, images, etc., to cotton fabrics through a heat press or home iron. There are two types of iron-on transfer paper for Inkjet printers - light and dark transfer paper.

#### **A. Light Transfer Paper**

This type of transfer paper's material is different from the dark one due to its translucent background, so it is highly recommended to use only on white or very light-colored cotton fabrics like cream, pale shades of pink, pale pastels, and the like, as long as it is not too dark.

**BEST FOR**

* White, Light, or Pale-Colored Cotton Fabrics

**PROS**

* Helps you achieve the desired result, especially when trimming the edges.
* Does a good job when you want a mirror image, making it look nice on the fabric.
* Lets you be creative and make designs on light fabrics for different projects.

**CONS**

* The transferred design may not be as durable, especially in high-wear or frequent washing situations.

#### **B. Dark Transfer Paper**

Dark transferable paper is great for black or colored fabrics, even white. But it's better to use light transfer paper for the best results for light fabrics. Dark paper is made so the fabric's color won't show in the background, and it won't affect the images you transfer.

**BEST FOR**
