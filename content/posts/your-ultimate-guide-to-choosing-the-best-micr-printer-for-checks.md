## **What Is a MICR Printer for Checks?**

[MICR (Magnetic Ink Character Recognition)](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/micr-what-it-is-and-how-it-works.html) is a specialized technology used for check printing. It uses a MICR Toner with iron oxide, allowing [MICR Readers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/micr-readers-understanding-how-it-reads-magnetic-ink-characters.html) to detect and verify printed characters, ensuring accurate check processing and fraud prevention.

* **High Accuracy** – The iron-infused ink prevents misreading or errors.
* **Security Against Fraud** – MICR printing makes check alterations more detectable.
* **Compliance with Banking Standards** – Banks require MICR-printed characters for processing.
