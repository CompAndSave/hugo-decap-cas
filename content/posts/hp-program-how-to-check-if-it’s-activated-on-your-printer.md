Want to make the most of your printer? HP+ is a feature provided by Hewlett-Packard that offers users an extended warranty and automatic ink delivery. But if you turn on HP+, there are some things you can't do, like using cheaper ink from third-party companies. So, how can you check if the HP+ Program is activated on your printer? In this guide, let’s discuss ways to check for HP+ activation on your printer and find out, “Is it [worth activating](https://www.compandsave.com/what-is-hp-plus-program-the-pros-and-cons)?” Let’s get started!

**In this guide, we will discuss:**

* HP+: Can I Deactivate It?

## HP+ Program: What Are Its Pros And Cons?

The HP+ Program is a subscription-based service offered by HP, providing subscribers with benefits such as automatic ink replenishment, extended warranty, and exclusive features. To know more about this program, let’s discuss some of its pros and cons:

### Pros:

* When you activate HP+ on your printer, you can get up to six months of free [HP+ Instant Ink](https://www.compandsave.com/what-is-hp-instant-ink-program), which sends you new ink before you run out.
* Your **printer's warranty becomes two years** instead of one.
* For the first two years, the HP Smart app offers extra features for free. After that, you might need to pay, but the basic features will still work.

### Cons:

* **Once you turn on the HP+ Program, you can't undo it**. If it doesn't suit you, you might need to buy a new printer because there's no way to turn it off.
* If you use HP+ ink, **you can't use cheaper ink from third-party companies** like what [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/) offers. Even if you stop using HP Instant Ink, you're still stuck with HP's original cartridges which are pricey.
* HP Instant Ink is free for up to the first six months, but after that, you have to pay monthly. HP+ cost depends on how much you print. If you don't print a lot, the subscription may be costlier than buying ink as needed. And if you print a lot, you could end up paying extra fees for going over your page limit.
* HP+ **requires a stable internet connection**. Without it, you might not be able to use all the features of the HP Smart app or get accurate information about your printer's ink levels or Instant Ink usage.

## HP+ Activation: How to Check On Your Printer?

So, how do you know if your printer is activated on the HP+ program? HP+ gives you a longer warranty for your printer, which is 2 years instead of just 1 year. If you're not sure whether HP+ is activated on your printer, you can verify it by checking the warranty status. Here's how you can do it:

**STEP 1: Find the Serial Number (S/N)**

Look for your printer's serial number. It's usually on a sticker on the back of the device.

**STEP 2: Go to the HP Warranty Check Tool**

Visit [HP Customer Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en), then scroll down and click **“Check Warranty Status.”**

**STEP 3: Enter Serial Number**

Input your printer's serial number into the designated field, then click **“Submit.”**

**STEP 4: Check the Warranty**

Look at the **"Service type"** listed. If it says 2 years instead of 1, it means HP+ is activated on your printer. For HP+ enabled printers, it might show "HP 2YR STD EXCHANGE – **HP+**." This means you're restricted to using original HP ink cartridges and can't use cheaper third-party ones.

## HP+: Can I Deactivate It? 

As of now, there is no option to deactivate HP+ once it has been activated. You're stuck with it and have to follow its rules. That means you must use original HP ink or toner as long as you have the printer. You also need to have an HP account and keep your printer connected to the Internet to keep getting the benefits. Considering these factors before opting in is essential, as **HP+ activation is irreversible**.

## Parting Words

How to know HP+ activation on your printer? Well, you have the steps in this guide! Just remember that the HP+ program offers a two-year warranty instead of one, and if you have it, it automatically means that you have activated HP+. This means you can't use aftermarket ink and toner on your HP printer anymore. So, before you sign up, think about whether it's worth it for you and your budget. Happy printing!

**Key takeaways:**

* HP+ offers an extended warranty, automatic ink delivery, and exclusive features, enhancing your printing experience.
* Activating HP+ on your printer cannot be undone. Think about your printing needs to see if the subscription is worth it for you.
* HP+ requires original HP ink cartridges, limiting the use of cheaper third-party alternatives.
