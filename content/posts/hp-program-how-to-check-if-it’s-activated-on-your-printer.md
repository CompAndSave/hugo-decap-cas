Plus, we’ll go over the pros and cons of the HP+ to help you decide if it’s right for you.

## HP+ Program: What Are Its Pros And Cons?

The HP+ Program is a subscription-based service offered by HP, providing subscribers with benefits such as automatic ink replenishment, extended warranty, and exclusive features. To know more about this program, let’s discuss some of its pros and cons:

### Pros

* When you activate HP+ on your printer, you can get up to six months of free [HP+ Instant Ink](https://www.compandsave.com/what-is-hp-instant-ink-program), which sends you new ink before you run out.
* Your printer's warranty becomes two years instead of one.
* For the first two years, the HP Smart app offers extra features for free. After that, you might need to pay, but the basic features will still work.

### Cons

* **Once you register your HP+ printers in the program, you can't undo it**. If it doesn't suit you, you might need to buy a new printer because there's no way to turn it off.
* If you use HP+ ink, **you can't use cheaper ink from third-party companies** like [CompAndSave](https://www.compandsave.com/) offers. Even if you cancel HP Instant Ink, you’re still stuck with HP’s original cartridges, which are expensive. Also, if you stop the subscription, you can’t use the cartridges anymore, even if there’s ink left in them.
* HP Instant Ink is free for up to the first six months, but after that, you have to pay monthly. HP+ cost depends on how much you print. If you don't print a lot, the subscription may be costlier than buying ink as needed. And if you print a lot, you could end up paying extra fees for going over your page limit.
* HP Plus **requires a stable internet connection.** Without it, you might not be able to use all the features of the HP Smart app or get accurate information about your printer's ink levels or Instant Ink usage.

## HP+ Activation: How To Check On Your Printer?

The HP+ program offers some great benefits, but it also has a few downsides. Now that you’re familiar with both, let's look at the steps on how to check HP+ activation on your printer quickly. Here are the steps you can follow:

### Step 1: Find the Serial Number (S/N)

Find your printer's serial number. You’ll usually see it on a sticker on the back, inside, or at the bottom of the printer. Check the sample picture below:

### Step 2: Go to the HP Warranty Check Tool

Visit [HP Customer Support](https://support.hp.com/us-en), then scroll down and click “Check Warranty Status.”

### Step 3: Enter Serial Number

Input your printer's serial number into the designated field, then click “Submit.”

### Step 4: Check the Warranty

Look at the "Service type" listed. If it says 2 years instead of 1, it means HP+ is activated on your printer. For HP+ enabled printers, it might show "HP 2YR STD EXCHANGE – HP+." This means you're restricted to using original HP ink cartridges and can't use cheaper third-party ones.

### Additionally, here’s a list of HP+ printers for quick reference:

**For HP DeskJet models**

* HP DeskJet 2700, 2800e, 4100, and 4200e series

**For HP ENVY models**

* ENVY 6000e, 6100e, 6400e, and 6500e series, 
* ENVY Inspire 7200 and 7900 series

**HP OfficeJet models**

* OfficeJet 8000e, 8100e, and 9100e series (excluding the 9110b)

## HP+ Printers: Can I Deactivate It?          

Currently, there is **no option to deactivate HP+** **once it has been activated.** You're stuck with it and have to follow its rules. That means you must use original HP ink or toner as long as you have the printer. You must also have an HP account and connect your printer to the internet to get the benefits. Considering these factors before signing up is essential, as **activating HP+ is irreversible.**

## Parting Words

So, how can we check HP+ activation on your printer? Well, you have the steps in this guide! Just remember that the HP+ program offers a two-year warranty on printers instead of one, and if you have it, it automatically means that you have activated HP+. This means you can't use cheaper third-party ink on your HP+ printers anymore. 

So, before you sign up, think about whether it's worth it for you and your budget. Print wisely and save more on ink costs!

**Key takeaways:**

* HP+ gives you a longer warranty, automatic ink delivery, and special features to make printing easier. But it also has downsides, like needing an internet connection and requiring original HP ink, which can be pricey.
* To check if HP+ is activated on your printer, visit the HP warranty check tool online, enter your printer's serial number, and if the "Service type" indicates 2 years, then HP+ is activated.
* Activating HP+ on your printer cannot be undone, so consider your printing needs before signing up for the subscription.
