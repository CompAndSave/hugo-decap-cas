## What Is Remanufactured Ink Cartridge?

Remanufactured means that something old or used is fixed and made like new again. So, what is remanufactured ink cartridge? For ink cartridges, this involves using original cartridges that have already been emptied. Instead of being thrown away and ending up in landfills, they are cleaned and inspected for damage, and any worn-out parts are replaced. After that, they’re refilled with fresh ink similar to the original.

These cartridges are different from OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) ones. OEM cartridges are brand new and made by the same company as your printer, while remanufactured cartridges are recycled and refilled by third-party companies. Compared to OEM cartridges, remanufactured ones are often cheaper and more eco-friendly, making them a good option for everyday printing.
