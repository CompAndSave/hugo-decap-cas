**How to use:**

1. Download and install the software.
2. Run it and select your printer.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to detect and fix the issue.

## **Advanced Fix: Downgrade Firmware to Restore Cartridge Compatibility**

When there is a problem with ink system and basic fixes don’t work, the issue often lies in a firmware update. HP's Dynamic Security blocks third-party or refilled cartridges, leading to ink system failure. Downgrading the firmware can restore cartridge compatibility and fix the ink system failure caused by these blocks.

### **1. Why Firmware Causes HP Printer Ink System Failure**

HP uses something called Dynamic Security, a feature designed to detect and reject non-HP ink. If there is a problem with the printer or ink system, and you're using third-party cartridges, this is likely the issue.

* A recent firmware update may have blocked your current cartridges.
* HP's firmware regularly disables cartridges it doesn’t recognize.
* Downgrading the firmware restores compatibility and removes the ink system failure message.

### **2. How to Downgrade HP Firmware**

Downgrading isn't risky if done right. Follow these steps to fix common printing errors caused by firmware:

* Find the correct firmware version: Visit trusted sources like [HP’s official site](https://support.hp.com) or forums like HP Support Community.
* Download firmware for your exact printer model.
* Enable service mode: Hold the power + cancel button for 5–10 seconds to unlock service options.

### **3. Downgrade HP Printer Firmware Using an .rfu File via LPR on Windows 10**

This process applies to HP printers that previously accepted .rfu firmware updates via LPR/port printing. Useful when:

* The printer is stuck on "Black Cartridge Depleted" or similar errors.
* USB firmware updates via .exe files are blocked or fail to downgrade.

This step requires Ethernet connection (not USB), and basic command-line use.

**Step 1: Download the Old Firmware (.rfu File)**

1. Visit the official or archived firmware list for your HP printer model.
2. Look for .rfu files (not .exe).
3. Download the appropriate .rfu version for your printer.
4. * Note: Do not run .exe firmware installers — they often block downgrades.

**Step 2: Connect the Printer via Ethernet**

1. **Disconnect the USB cable**.
2. Connect the printer to your PC using an Ethernet cable.
3. Because the printer is unresponsive or stuck in a menu, you need to force it to get an IP:

**Step 3: Share Internet to Give Printer an IP (via Internet Connection Sharing)**

1. Open **Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Change Adapter Settings**.
2. Right-click your **active internet connection** → **Properties** → **Sharing tab**.
3. Check **“Allow other network users to connect…”** and select the **Ethernet** port (connected to the printer).
4. Power cycle (turn off/on) the printer.

**Step 4: Find Printer's IP Address**

1. Press Windows + R, type cmd, and press **Enter**.
2. In the Command Prompt, type:

{{< embedImage image="/blog/images/screenshot-2025-06-29-at-8.55.30 am.png" alt="arp -a" title="arp-a" alignment="center" >}}

3. Look for two IP addresses in the 192.168.137.x range:

* .1 is your PC’s shared port.
* The **other one** is the printer’s IP. Example: 192.168.137.123.

**Step 5: Enable LPR Printing on Windows**

1. Open **Control Panel**.
2. Go to **Programs > Turn Windows features on or off**.
3. Scroll to **Print and Document Services**:
4. * Enable:

   * ✅ LPD Print Service
   * ✅ LPR Port Monitor
5. Click OK and let Windows apply changes.

**Step 6: Send Firmware via LPR Command**

1. In Command Prompt, navigate to the folder where your .rfu file is.
2. Use the following command to send the firmware:

{{< embedImage image="/blog/images/screenshot-2025-06-29-at-9.08.48 am.png" alt="lpr-s" title="lpr-s" alignment="center" >}}

**Replace:**

* \[Printer_IP] with the IP you found (e.g., 192.168.137.123)
* firmwarefilename.rfu with the actual file name

**Step 7: Retry Until It Works**

This part can take **patience**:

1. Keep turning the printer **off and on**.
2. After turning it on, **quickly** run the above lpr command again.
3. If needed, open and close the printer lid to help it initialize.
4. Repeat several times — success is when the printer shows a **green firmware update screen** with progress like 1 2 3 4 5.



**Step 8: Verify Downgrade Success**

* The printer will reboot with older firmware.
* Cartridge-related errors like “depleted” or “leaking” should be resolved.
* You may now use previously incompatible cartridges again.

**Troubleshooting Tips**

* Ensure the .rfu file matches your exact printer model.
* Make sure your firewall doesn’t block LPR traffic.
* If lpr isn't recognized, add Windows' LPR tools to your PATH or use full path.

## **If the Problem Persists: Replace the Printhead or Motherboard**
