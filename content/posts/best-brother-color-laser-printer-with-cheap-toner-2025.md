Brother printers have long been trusted for their reliability, solid performance, and crisp print quality. Their color laser models are especially popular among home users and small businesses that need fast, professional-looking prints. But while the printers themselves are built to last, toner costs can get expensive over time, especially if you print often. That’s why choosing the best Brother color laser printer is so important.

In this guide, we’ll help you find a Brother laserjet color printer that’s not only reliable but also compatible with more affordable toner options. If you only need black-and-white printing, you can also refer to our guide for the [Best Brother Monochrome Laser Printers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/brother-monochrome-laser-printer-our-top-picks-in-2025.html)!

## **Brother LaserJet Color Printer vs. Monochrome Laser Printer: Which One Should You Choose?**

Deciding between a Brother color laser printer and a monochrome laser printer depends on what and how often you print. Before making a choice, consider the type of printing you do most.

### **Choose a monochrome laser printer if:**

* You mostly print black-and-white text, such as forms, invoices, or reports.
* You want the lowest cost per page possible.
* Speed and simplicity are top priorities.
* You're running a business that doesn’t require color graphics.

### **Choose a color laser printer if:**

* You print documents with graphics, logos, or marketing materials.
* You need professional-looking documents with vibrant colors.
* You manage school projects, client presentations, or creative tasks.
* You want an all-in-one printer for both color and black-and-white needs.

## **What Features Should You Look for Besides Printing?**

Picking the right Brother laserjet color printer isn’t just about print speed or quality. The right features can make your workflow smoother and your life easier. Here are key questions to ask yourself before buying:

* **Do I need scanning, copying, or faxing?**

  If so, consider a Brother colour laser multifunction printer. These allow you to do everything—scan to email, copy ID cards, or fax a contract—without needing additional devices.
* **How many people will use this printer?**

  If the printer will be shared in a home or office, look for one with wireless printing, a large paper tray, and a high monthly duty cycle. These features help reduce paper jams and make sure everyone can print smoothly without waiting.
* **Will I print from phones, tablets, or laptops?**

  If you want to print from mobile devices, choose a Brother wireless color laser printer with Wi-Fi Direct or Apple AirPrint. These let you print directly from your phone, tablet, or laptop—no cables or complicated setup required.
* **Do I print double-sided pages often?**

  If you frequently print reports, booklets, or multi-page documents, consider getting a printer with automatic duplex printing capabilities. It prints on both sides of the page for you, saving paper, time, and money.
* **Do I need a touchscreen or an easy menu system?**

  A color touchscreen makes the printer easier to use. You can check toner levels, change settings, and set up scan or copy shortcuts—all without needing to read a manual.
