For years, Brother printers had a great reputation for being reliable, affordable, and compatible with third-party toner. Unlike HP printers, which have a long history of blocking non-OEM cartridges, Brother was a go-to choice for consumers looking to save money.

But now, things are changing. Many users report that recent Brother printer updates reduce print quality when using third-party toner and disabling key features. Some call this a forced ink lockdown, comparing it to [HP’s Dynamic Security updates](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-disable-hp-cartridge-protection), which restrict non-OEM cartridges. 

***So, is Brother following in HP’s footsteps?*** Let’s break down this Brother printer issue.

## Brother Printers: A Quick Overview

Brother Industries is a Japanese electronics company that makes printers, sewing machines, and office equipment. Founded in 1908, it started as a sewing machine repair business before expanding into electronics.

Today, Brother printers are popular for being affordable, durable, and efficient. They are widely used in homes and offices because they offer:

* Cost-effective laser printers with low running costs.
* Reliable performance with minimal maintenance.
* Compatible with third-party toner (until recent firmware issues).

Unlike HP, Brother printer company was seen as a consumer-friendly brand that allowed users to choose their toner, even cheaper alternative ones. 

## **Why Are Printer Companies Blocking Third-Party Ink?**

Printer companies like Brother, HP, and Canon greatly profit from selling original ink and toner. Many brands sell their printers at a loss and compensate for it by charging high prices for official ink.

To protect these profits, some companies have started using firmware updates to:

* **Disable third-party ink** (like HP’s Dynamic Security)
* **Lower print quality** when using non-official toner.
* **Display warning messages** to push users toward official supplies.

Brother printers were once a favorite for people who used third-party toner. However, with recent firmware updates, some customers worry that Brother is shifting toward ink restrictions like HP. This has led to frustration among users who trusted Brother for affordability and freedom of choice.

## **So, What’s Happening with Brother Printer Updates?**

According to [Louis Rossmann’s Wiki](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/wiki/Brother_ink_lockout_%26_quality_sabotage), recent Brother printer updates are causing big issues for people who use third-party toner. Rossmann, a well-known right-to-repair advocate with over 2 million YouTube subscribers, has highlighted how updates like firmware version W1.56 have made it harder to get the same print quality and performance as before. Here’s a closer look at what’s going on:

### **1. Firmware Updates That Remove Features**

Brother has released updates that quietly disable or change key functions, especially for non-Brother toner users. Here’s how it affects users:

**No More Automatic Color Registration**

* Normally, printers automatically adjust colors to keep them properly aligned. This helps prevent blurry or misaligned prints.
* The new update turns off this feature, meaning colors might not print where they should. This can make text and images look off-centered or distorted, especially in color documents.

**Lower Print Quality on Third-Party Ink/Toner**

* Before the update, many users could print with third-party toner without problems.
* Now, the printer deliberately lowers the quality when non-Brother toner is detected. This can make prints look faded, streaky, or dull, even if the third party ink cartridges or toner is high quality.

Because of these updates, many users who had no issues before are now struggling with misaligned prints, faded colors, and lower quality—all because they don’t use Brother’s official toner.

### **2. Vendor Lock-in: Third-Party Toner Works—But Badly**

Unlike HP, Brother printers don’t outright block third-party toner. Instead, they allow you to install it but then make the print quality significantly worse. This tactic forces customers to switch to expensive Brother Genuine toner if they want normal printing.

Users on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31860131) and Reddit forum have reported that after a firmware update, their Brother printers:

* Print at degraded quality with third-party toner.
* Failing to register colors properly, making text and images misaligned.
* Work instantly when Brother OEM toner is installed, proving the issue is software-related. 

### **3. Automatic Updates with No Undo Option**

The biggest issue? Brother firmware updates install automatically when the printer is connected to the internet. Brother does not give a clear warning that these updates could affect print quality or limit third-party toner use.

Once the update is installed, there’s no easy way to undo it. Brother has removed older firmware versions from their website, so you can’t go back to a previous version that worked better. If the update causes problems, you’re stuck with it. Your only options are to deal with poor print quality or buy Brother’s expensive toner.

## **Brother Printer Issue: What Is Brother Saying About It?**

After gaining attention from [Louis Rossmann’s YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpHX_9fHNqE&t=315s) and coverage by [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/brother-denies-using-firmware-updates-to-brick-printers-with-third-party-ink/), Brother released an official statement denying claims that their firmware updates block third-party toner or ink:

*“We are aware of the recent false claims suggesting that a Brother firmware update may have restricted the use of third-party ink cartridges. Please be assured that Brother firmware updates do not block the use of third-party ink in our machines.”*

Brother further explained that:

* Their firmware updates do not block third-party toner.
* The updates do not intentionally lower print quality.
* They can’t guarantee print quality when non-Brother toner is used.
* If users have print problems, their troubleshooting process suggests trying Brother’s own toner to rule out issues.

Despite this statement, many users still report problems after firmware updates, leading to mixed opinions. Let’s take a closer look at what users are saying.

## **Some Brother Printer Reviews: Are Users Still Happy with Brother?**

People have different opinions about the Brother printer issue. Some say their printers still work fine after a Brother printer update, while others notice faded prints, misaligned pages, or [third-party toner no longer working](https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/1b9mdch/brother_printer_suddenly_wont_accept_third_party/). Brother says the updates help performance, but results depend on the printer model, toner brand, and update version.

Many still prefer Brother over HP, saying it’s reliable, low-maintenance, and affordable. Some believe firmware updates are needed for security and that toner problems may come from low-quality third-party brands. But even happy users are watching closely—if Brother starts blocking third-party toner, they worry it might become like HP.

To get a better sense of user experiences, here’s what some of them say in Reddit posts by [Kodiak01](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1j42fb4/so_now_that_brother_has_decided_that_hp_is_the/), [Lumanus](https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/1b9mdch/brother_printer_suddenly_wont_accept_third_party/), and [zekrysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/1j22e1h/has_brother_gone_the_way_of_hp_looking_for_new/):

## **Disable Automatic Firmware Updates: A Way To Prevent Ink/Toner Issues**

The good news is that if you're worried about the Brother printer issue and want to keep using third-party toner or ink, you can turn off automatic updates. This prevents your printer from installing firmware that might cause problems. Here’s how to do it:

* **For network-connected printers:** Go to the printer’s settings menu, find the firmware update option, and turn off automatic updates.
* **For USB-connected printers:** Avoid using Brother’s software update tools when installing drivers. Instead, download only the necessary drivers from Brother’s official website.
* **For all printers:** Block Brother’s update servers at the router level if possible. This prevents the printer from downloading updates in the background.

## **Final Thoughts: Should You Still Buy a Brother Printer?**

Brother printers have long been a popular choice for their reliability and affordability. But with recent Brother printer updates, some users are facing unexpected headaches—especially those using third-party toner or ink. Reports of lower print quality, missing features, and blocked cartridges have made many question if Brother is following HP’s path of restricting non-OEM supplies.

However, not everyone has a Brother printer issue. If you use Brother’s official toner, your printer should work as expected. But if you prefer third-party cartridges, you may need to disable automatic updates or consider other brands. In the end, it comes down to whether you're willing to pay for Brother’s toner or take steps to keep using alternatives. The choice is yours depending on your needs and budget!

**Key Takeaways:**

* Recent updates suggest Brother is making it harder to use non-Brother ink cartridges, similar to HP’s ink restrictions.
* The company claims its updates don’t block third-party ink or lower print quality but admits they can’t guarantee performance with non-Brother supplies.
* Turning off firmware updates in printer settings or blocking Brother’s update servers can help maintain compatibility with third-party toner.
