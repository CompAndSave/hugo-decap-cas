For years, Brother printers had a great reputation for being reliable, affordable, and compatible with third-party toner. Unlike HP printers, which have a long history of blocking non-OEM cartridges, Brother was a go-to choice for consumers looking to save money.

But now, things are changing. Many users report that recent Brother printer updates reduce print quality when using third-party toner and disabling key features. Some call this a forced ink lockdown, comparing it to [HP’s Dynamic Security updates](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-disable-hp-cartridge-protection), which restrict non-OEM cartridges.
