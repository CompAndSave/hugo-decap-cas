While [pocket printers](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/pocket-size-printers-reality-or-a-figment-of-the-imagination.html) are ideal for travellers, larger mini models suit remote office setups.

Modern portable printers must support Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile apps like AirPrint and Mopria. These let you print from phones, tablets, or laptops without cables. A wireless compact printer increases productivity on the move.

Choose a battery inkjet printer with internal batteries that print 100–300 pages per charge. USB-C charging adds convenience. A reliable portable ink printer won’t leave you stranded mid-task.
