## How Does Cloud Printing Work?

The foundation of cloud-ready printing is the Internet. It eliminates the need for local networks and direct connections. Here’s a simple overview of how it operates:

* **Upload.** First, you upload your document to the cloud service linked to your printer, such as Google Cloud Print.
