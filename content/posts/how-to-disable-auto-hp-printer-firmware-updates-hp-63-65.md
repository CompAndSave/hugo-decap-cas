## HP Printer Firmware Update: Why Do This Happen?

HP printers sometimes need firmware updates to fix bugs, add new features, and improve performance. These updates are like software upgrades for your printer, helping it run smoothly and stay compatible with other devices and software.

However, as you may already know, the HP automatic updates of printer firmware will cause cartridge chip lock-outs, making HP remanufactured ink cartridges unrecognizable. Once the firmware is updated, the HP printer will now only accept original or genuine ink cartridges.

So, if you wish to continue using cheaper third-party [HP 65](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/65-ink-cartridges/n9k02an-n9k01an-2-combo)/[HP 63](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/63-ink-cartridges/f6u62an-f6u61an-2-combo) ink cartridges or [HP 65XL](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/65xl-ink-cartridges/n9k04an-black)/[HP 63XL](https://www.compandsave.com/hp/63xl-ink-cartridges/f6u64an-black) ink cartridges, we will show you the steps to disable HP firmware update and make your ink cartridges work again.

## HP Auto Update: Steps On How To Disable In HP 63/65

To stop your HP printer from updating automatically, follow these steps to disable your printer's HP auto update feature. We have listed the steps for both printers with touch screen control and those without.

### A. For Printers with Touchscreen Control Panel

You can choose from the two methods below on how to turn off firmware on HP printer automatically if it has a touchscreen control panel.

**METHOD 1: From the Printer’s Control Panel**

**Step 1:** Select the **“Setup”** icon on your printer’s control panel. From the list of options, choose **“Tools.”**

**Step 2:** On the Tools display, select **“Update the Printer”** and then choose **“Printer Update Options.”**

**METHOD 2: From Printer Homepage via Browser**

This method will work on HP network-capable printers and Wi-Fi Direct Printers. To access the printer homepage, you must first obtain the printer IP address and enter it into a web browser address bar. IP address is the unique identification number assigned to the printer, depending on the network.

**Step 1:** Select the **“Setup”** icon from your printer’s control panel while your printer is connected to the network. From the list of options, choose **“Network Setup.”** You should be able to see your printer’s IP address on the top of the display screen.

***NOTE:** Every printer's IP address is unique, depending on your network. The address shown in the photo below is for sample purposes only.*

**Step 2:** Update HP printer firmware over network by entering your printer’s IP address in your web browser's address bar (the address bar is where a website’s link is usually located, like the photo below). Once it's loaded, you should be able to see your printer’s homepage.

**Step 3:** Click the **“Printer Update”** option from the home dashboard.

**Step 4:** Next, make sure that the checkbox for **“Install updates automatically (recommended)”** in the **“Printer Update Options”** section is unchecked. This will disable your printer's auto firmware update feature. Once done, click the **“Apply”** button to save the settings.

5. You may also confirm the "Automatic Firmware Update" status by pressing the "i" button on your printer's control panel. It will print out your “Printer Information Page” which will show the status of your auto update setting.

## For Printers without Touchscreen Control Panel

You can disable the auto update from your printer homepage via web browser. To do so, you would need to print out your “Printer's Status Report” first to obtain the IP address.

1. Make sure your printer is connected to the network by pressing "Wi-Fi" and "Wi-Fi Direct" buttons on your printer control panel. For printers without the "Wi-Fi Direct" button, you may press on the "Wi-Fi" button only.

2. Once your printer is connected to the network, you can print out your “Printer's Status Report” by pressing both "i" and "Wi-Fi" buttons for at least three seconds. On your printed report, you should be able to find your printer's Wi-Fi name and password, along with the printer's IP Address.
