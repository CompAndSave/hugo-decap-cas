### A. For Printers with Touchscreen Control Panel

You can choose from the two methods below on how to turn off firmware on HP printer automatically if it has a touchscreen control panel.

**Step 1:** Select the **“Setup”** icon on your printer’s control panel. From the list of options, choose **“Tools.”**

**METHOD 2: From Printer Homepage via Browser**

This method will work on HP network-capable printers and Wi-Fi Direct Printers. To access the printer homepage, you must first obtain the printer IP address and enter it into a web browser address bar. IP address is the unique identification number assigned to the printer, depending on the network.

**Step 1:** Select the **“Setup”** icon from your printer’s control panel while your printer is connected to the network. From the list of options, choose **“Network Setup.”** You should be able to see your printer’s IP address on the top of the display screen.

***NOTE:** Every printer's IP address is unique, depending on your network. The address shown in the photo below is for sample purposes only.*

**Step 2:** Update HP printer firmware over network by entering your printer’s IP address in your web browser's address bar (the address bar is where a website’s link is usually located, like the photo below). Once it's loaded, you should be able to see your printer’s homepage.

**Step 4:** Next, make sure that the checkbox for **“Install updates automatically (recommended)”** in the **“Printer Update Options”** section is unchecked. This will disable your printer's auto firmware update feature. Once done, click the **“Apply”** button to save the settings.

**Step 5:** You may also confirm the **“Automatic Firmware Update”** status by pressing the **“i”** button on your printer’s control panel. This will print out your **“Printer Information Page,”** which shows the status of your auto-update setting.

### B. For Printers Without Touchscreen Control Panel

You can disable the auto HP printer firmware update from your printer homepage via a web browser. To do so, you must print out your **“Printer’s Status Report”** first to obtain the IP address.

**Step 1:** Make sure your printer is connected to the network by pressing the **“Wi-Fi”** and **“Wi-Fi Direct”** buttons on your printer control panel. You may press the “Wi-Fi Direct” button only for printers without the “Wi-Fi” button.

**Step 2:** Once your printer is connected to the network, you can print out your **“Printer’s Status Report”** by pressing both **“i”** and **“Wi-Fi”** buttons for at least three seconds. In your printed report, you should be able to find your printer’s Wi-Fi name and password, along with the printer’s IP address.
