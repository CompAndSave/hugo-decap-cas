You might be wondering why your HP printer not recognizing ink cartridges when it was working fine the first time. If you are using third-party, generic or remanufactured ink cartridge, there is a big possibility that this issue is due to your HP printer's firmware being updated to its latest version.

### Procedure 2: From Printer Homepage via Browser

This method will work on HP network-capable printers and Wi-Fi Direct Printers. To access the printer homepage, you would first need to obtain the printer IP address, and enter it to a web browser address bar. IP address is the unique identification number assigned to the printer, depending on the network.

1. While your printer is connected to the network, select "**Setup**" icon from your printer's control panel. From the list of options, choose "**Network Setup**". You should be able to see your printer's IP address on the top of the display screen.

**NOTE:** The IP address is unique for every printer depending on your network. The address shown on the photo below is for sample purposes only.

2. Enter your printer's IP address on your web browser address bar (web address bar is where a website's link is usually located). You should be able to see your printer homepage once it's loaded.

4. Next, you want to make sure that the checkbox for "Install updates automatically (recommended)" on the “Printer Update Options” section is unchecked. This will disable the auto firmware update feature on your printer. Once you're done, click the "Apply" button to save the settings.
