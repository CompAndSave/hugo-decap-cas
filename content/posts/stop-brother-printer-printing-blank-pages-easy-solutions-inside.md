The Brother printer printing blank pages issue is one of the most common printer problems users face, and it doesn’t always mean the machine is broken. Sometimes, the fix is simple and takes minutes. Other times, it’s caused by hidden settings, clogged nozzles, or a glitch the printer can’t resolve on its own.

Whether it’s a home inkjet or an office laser, a Brother printer blank pages can happen for many reasons. It could be a blocked printhead, outdated firmware, or even a Brother printer that cannot detect cartridge error. Whatever the cause, there’s a way to diagnose and fix it without unnecessary stress.

**In this article, we’ll cover:**

* Why does your Brother [printer printing blank pages](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/why-is-my-printer-printing-blank-pages.html)
* Quick fixes for the Brother printer only printing blank pages

## **Why Does My Brother Printer Has Ink But Prints Blank Pages?**

If your Brother printer is printing blank pages, it doesn’t always mean the ink or toner is empty. Many users face Brother printer blank pages issues even with full cartridges. According to Brother support, printing blank pages is a common printer problem caused by clogs, misconfigured settings, or a Brother printer that cannot detect a cartridge error. Some fixes are quick; others need deeper inspection.

Below are the main reasons why a Brother printer has ink but prints blank pages, and what each means for your device.

### **1. Clogged Printhead or Nozzle Blockage**

Inkjet models are prone to dried ink buildup in the printhead nozzles. This stops ink from reaching the paper, resulting in a Brother printer only printing blank pages. Regular cleaning cycles can help, but severe blockages may require manual cleaning.

### **2. Driver or Firmware Glitches**

Outdated or corrupted drivers can cause the Brother printer to print blank pages. A firmware bug can also disrupt ink flow commands from the computer to the printer. Updating both drivers and firmware often resolves this.

### **3. Incorrect Printer Settings** 

Wrong settings can trigger blank output. For example, if the “Skip Blank Page” feature is enabled or the paper size doesn’t match the document, your Brother printer keeps printing blank pages unintentionally. Checking the printer’s menu and print preferences can fix this.

### **4. Air Bubbles in the Ink Cartridge**

Sometimes, air gets trapped inside an ink cartridge, blocking ink flow. This can happen after cartridge replacement or if the printer hasn’t been used for a while. Even with a full cartridge, air bubbles can cause the Brother printer to print blank pages.

### **5. Corrupted Document Formatting or Software Errors**

Hidden blank pages or misaligned formatting in Word, PDF, or Excel files can trick the printer into outputting empty sheets. Clearing these errors before printing prevents unnecessary Brother printer blank pages.

### **6. Hardware Issues (Drum Unit, Laser Assembly, Feed Rollers)**

In laser models, a faulty drum unit or laser assembly can cause the Brother printer to print blank pages. Feed roller problems may also prevent paper from passing through correctly, producing partial or empty prints.

## **Quick Fixes for Brother Printer Blank Pages**

When you are in this  situation, “my Brother printer is printing blank pages”, the first step is to act quickly. Many common printer problems can be solved in minutes without replacing parts. Most fixes for Brother printer printing blank pages work for both inkjet and laser models. Below are proven steps to get your printer working again.

### **Step 1 – Run a Printer Test Page**

Printing a test page confirms if the issue is with the printer or the document.

* **Windows:** Go to Settings > Devices > Printers & Scanners > Your Printer > Manage > Print a test page.
* **macOS:** Open System Settings > Printers & Scanners > Your Printer > Options & Supplies > Utility > Print Test Page.

If the test page is blank, the Brother printer blank pages problem is within the printer. If it prints correctly, the issue lies in the document or application.

### **Step 2 – Perform Printhead Cleaning**

Clogged nozzles are a top cause of the Brother printer only printing blank pages.

* **Automatic cleaning:** From your printer’s menu, run “Cleaning” or “Deep Cleaning.”
* **Manual cleaning:** If automatic fails, remove the cartridges and clean the printhead with a lint-free cloth and warm distilled water.

### **Step 3 – Check Printer Settings**

Incorrect settings can cause a Brother printer to have ink but print blank pages.

* Disable “Skip Blank Page” or “Separator Page” in your printer preferences.
* Confirm paper size and type match the document.

### **Step 4 – Update or Reinstall Printer Drivers**

Driver errors can cause the Brother printer to print blank output.

* **Windows:** Uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers from the Brother Support Site.
* **macOS:** Remove the printer from settings and add it again to trigger driver updates.

### **Step 5 – Inspect and Reseat Cartridges**

Sometimes a Brother printer cannot detect a cartridge even when it’s full.

* Power off, remove cartridges, and gently clean the contacts.
* Reinstall firmly to eliminate air bubble issues.

### **Step 6 – Try a Firmware Update**

Firmware updates fix known bugs that cause Brother printer keeps printing blank pages. Download the latest version from Brother’s official site and follow the on-screen instructions.

### **Step 7 – Reset the Printer**

If all else fails, restore factory settings.

* Access “Reset” in your printer’s menu.
* This clears misconfigured settings that may trigger the Brother printer to print blank pages.

## **Advanced Fixes for Persistent Blank Page Problems**

If the quick solutions didn’t stop your Brother printer printing blank pages, it’s time to look deeper. Some [common printer problems](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-fix-common-printer-problems-tips-for-easy-troubleshooting.html) are tied to internal components, especially in laser models or heavily used inkjets. These fixes address the more technical causes of printer blank pages when the simple steps fail.

### **1. Cleaning Brother Laser Printer Corona Wire or Drum Unit**

In laser printers, a dirty corona wire or damaged drum unit can cause faint or completely blank pages.

* Open the printer and remove the drum unit.
* Slide the corona wire cleaner from left to right several times.
* Avoid touching the wire directly, as it’s delicate.

### **2. Replacing a Faulty Printhead**

In inkjets, the printhead delivers ink to paper. If repeated cleanings don’t restore output, replacing the printhead is often the only fix. Always use genuine Brother parts to prevent further issues.

### **3. Fixing Document Formatting Issues (Word, PDF, Excel)**

Sometimes, when a Brother printer prints a blank page comes from the file itself.

* Remove hidden blank pages in Word by enabling paragraph marks.
* In PDFs, use “Print as Image” or remove extra pages in a PDF editor.
* In Excel, set the print area to avoid empty cells.
