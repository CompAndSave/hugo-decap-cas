## Refill Printer Ink Cartridges: Why Refill Instead of Buying a New One

Printer ink is a liquid substance used in printers to create text and images on paper. It usually comes in small cartridges that are inserted into the printer. The ink is sprayed onto the paper in tiny droplets, forming the characters and pictures you see on the page. Different printers use different types of ink, but the basic idea is to transfer the ink onto the paper in a controlled manner to produce the desired text or image.

### So, why refill printer ink cartridges?

* **Cost Savings:** Choosing to refill your ink cartridges is a smart way to save money. It's less expensive than buying new ones, especially using the right ink refill kit and tools. 
* **Prolonged Printing Capacity:** Refilling printer ink cartridges allows you to add more ink than what comes in commercial cartridges. This means you won't have to buy new cartridges as often, making the cartridges last longer. 
* **Environmental Impact:** Refilling is environmentally friendly as it helps reduce landfill waste, contributing to a more sustainable printing practice.

### Step 1 - Prepare the Refilling Area

Refilling printer ink can get messy, especially for first-timers. Since the ink is permanent and can stain clothes and surfaces, it's wise to wear old clothes and cover the area with tissue paper or newspaper. Additionally, wearing gloves will prevent ink spills on your hands. While the stain won't be permanent on your skin, it can linger for quite a while.

### Step 2 - Remove Your Cartridge

Next, take out your ink cartridge. It's easy to do, and how you do it can vary between printers. Check your printer manual to determine how it's done for your printer.

### Step 3 - Read the Refill Kit's Instructions

Many ink cartridge refill kits, including the one from CompAndSave, have a manual with step-by-step instructions. This helps you refill the cartridge correctly the first time. Refer to the [CompAndSave Universal Refill Kit Manual](https://www.compandsave.com/assets/instruction_ink_refill_kit_for_inkjet_printer.pdf) for a more detailed process.

### Step 4 - Find the Filling Hole

[![ink cartridge filling hole](/blog/images/refill-ink-2.png "Ink Cartridge Filling Hole")](/blog/images/refill-ink-2.png)

To refill ink cartridges, first, find the fill hole. Look at the linked [instruction PDF](https://www.compandsave.com/assets/instruction_ink_refill_kit_for_inkjet_printer.pdf) for guidance on where to fill based on your cartridge's color. Some cartridges, like HP, have clear holes, while others, like [Canon BCI-3e](https://www.compandsave.com/canon/bci-3e-ink-cartridges), may have points on top. [Dell T0529](https://www.compandsave.com/dell/series-1-ink-cartridges-s-7427/t0529-t0530-2-combo-p-10226) cartridges might have air vents. Check the [detailed PDF](https://www.compandsave.com/assets/instruction_ink_refill_kit_for_inkjet_printer.pdf) for specific instructions on your specific cartridge.

If your refillable cartridges don't have a clear hole, peel off the top label to find potential filling spots. For multiple colors, the [universal kit manual](https://www.compandsave.com/assets/instruction_ink_refill_kit_for_inkjet_printer.pdf) will guide you. Some cartridges have twist caps covering holes; remove them to uncover the fill hole(s). If there are multiple holes, find the right one with spongy material.

If the hole is closed, use the drill bit or screw tool from the Universal Refill Kit to open it. If there's no seal, a toothpick works well, too.

### Step 5 - Fill The Syringe

Now, use the syringe from the refill kit. Put it into the ink bottle with the kit and start filling. The amount you need depends on your printer ink cartridge size. Check your cartridge model online for the right amount for each hole. Alternatively, start with 3-4 ml in the syringe, refill as needed, and continue until you're done.

### Step 6 - Add Ink To the Cartridge

Carefully remove the syringe needle from the ink bottle and insert it into the cartridge hole. Gently push the plunger down to prevent air bubbles. Stop when the ink comes out of the hole, indicating it's filled to the top. To avoid overfilling, pull the plunger slightly to remove excess ink. Now, you're ready to go!

### Step 7 - Clean and Cover

After filling the cartridge holes and putting the syringe away, use a paper towel to wipe the top of the cartridge, ensuring no ink traces remain. When inserting it back into the printer, avoid getting the area wet. To complete the printer cartridge refill correctly, seal the holes with clear scotch tape to prevent ink from leaking when the cartridge is inside the printer.

### Step 8 - Test Print

The final step in refilling the ink cartridge is to place it back into the printer and [print a few test pages](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-print-test-page-on-windows-and-mac) to ensure the colored ink flows correctly. Print all the colors to ensure each one is working properly.

## Ink Cartridge Refill: Tips When Refilling

When you refill your printer's ink, remember a few important things to get the most out of refilling and keep your printer working well. Here are some tips when refilling your cartridges:

### 1. Get a Refilling Kit

When you want to refill ink cartridges, you'll find different choices out there. It's essential to pick a universal refilling kit so you can fill up most inkjet cartridges. This way, no matter what printer you get later on, you can still refill its ink cartridge.

### 2. Refill Before the Cartridge Dries Out

Fill up your cartridge before it runs out of ink entirely. Do it when you see the ink is low. This keeps the sponge inside wet and makes refilling easier. If you wait too long, the sponge dries out, and the cartridge becomes empty. Trying to refill a dried-out cartridge is challenging and might need careful handling.

### 3. Refill Slow and Steady

When refilling ink cartridges, take your time, proceeding with a slow and steady injection motion. This approach helps in proper ink distribution, minimizing clogs and spills that may cause printing complications, thus contributing to a cleaner cartridge refill.

### 4. Avoid Overfilling

Avoid putting too much ink in the cartridge. Overfilling means adding more ink than the cartridge can hold. This might seem like a good idea to avoid running out of ink quickly, but it can cause problems. When the cartridge is overfilled, it can lead to poor print quality and even damage your printer. Following the recommended refilling levels is crucial to ensure your printer's optimal performance and prevent potential issues.

### 5. Clean Refill Syringes

Make sure your syringe is clean before putting in new ink. If it's not clean, the old ink left in it can mix with the new ink, and your printouts might have different colors than you want. Use rubbing alcohol to clean the syringe before refilling the printer ink, and rinse it well.

### 6. Let the Ink Settle

After refilling an ink cartridge, allow the ink to settle before printing to ensure high-quality prints without flaws or irregularities. Injecting ink disrupts the cartridge's internal pressure, so after refilling, place the cartridge on paper towels for 15 minutes before reinserting it into the printer. This stabilizes internal pressure and drains off any excess ink.

### 7. Storing Refilled Cartridges

If you have extra cartridges you want to refill and keep for later use, store them properly. Keep your ink cartridges in a cool, dark place. Keep them from heat or direct sunlight. Also, store them in a container with a desiccant to absorb moisture. This will prevent the ink from drying out and clogging the print head.

## Buy Compatible and Remanufactured Ink Cartridges: Other Options than Refilling

Printer ink refill might seem easy, but it could be too much work for your business or printing needs. Buying OEM cartridges is an option, but it's expensive. Luckily, there's a cheaper and easier third option.
