## Refill Printer Ink Cartridges: Why Refill Instead of Buying a New One

Printer ink is a liquid substance used in printers to create text and images on paper. It usually comes in small cartridges that are inserted into the printer. The ink is sprayed onto the paper in tiny droplets, forming the characters and pictures you see on the page. Different printers use different types of ink, but the basic idea is to transfer the ink onto the paper in a controlled manner to produce the desired text or image.

### So, why refill printer ink cartridges?

* **Cost Savings:** Choosing to refill your ink cartridges is a smart way to save money. It's less expensive than buying new ones, especially using the right ink refill kit and tools. 
* **Prolonged Printing Capacity:** Refilling printer ink cartridges allows you to add more ink than what comes in commercial cartridges. This means you won't have to buy new cartridges as often, making the cartridges last longer. 
* **Environmental Impact:** Refilling is environmentally friendly as it helps reduce landfill waste, contributing to a more sustainable printing practice.

### Step 1 - Prepare the Refilling Area

Refilling printer ink can get messy, especially for first-timers. Since the ink is permanent and can stain clothes and surfaces, it's wise to wear old clothes and cover the area with tissue paper or newspaper. Additionally, wearing gloves will prevent ink spills on your hands. While the stain won't be permanent on your skin, it can linger for quite a while.

### Step 2 - Remove Your Cartridge

Next, take out your ink cartridge. It's easy to do, and how you do it can vary between printers. Check your printer manual to determine how it's done for your printer.

### Step 3 - Read the Refill Kit's Instructions

Many ink cartridge refill kits, including the one from CompAndSave, have a manual with step-by-step instructions. This helps you refill the cartridge correctly the first time. Refer to the [CompAndSave Universal Refill Kit Manual](https://www.compandsave.com/assets/instruction_ink_refill_kit_for_inkjet_printer.pdf) for a more detailed process.
