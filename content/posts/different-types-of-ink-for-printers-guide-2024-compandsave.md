The 20th century saw the rise of digital printing with inkjet printers using dye-based and pigment-based inks and laser printers using powdered toner.

## Different Types of Ink for Printer: The Ultimate Guide

Printers use different types of printing inks, each designed for specific functions. Printer cartridges often indicate they are empty before they are to prevent damage. Surprisingly, most color printing uses only three colors: yellow, cyan, and magenta. Some inks are even edible and used for printing on food. Printer ink is very expensive, often costing thousands per gallon. Additionally, using recyclable cartridges can reduce costs and benefit the environment.

Let’s take a look at different types of ink for printers:

### 1. Inkjet Printer Inks

Inkjet printers are popular for their ability to produce high-quality prints. They use two main types of ink: dye-based and pigment-based, each with unique characteristics and best uses. Additionally, specialized inks like sublimation and direct-to-garment (DTG) inks cater to specific printing needs.

#### **1.1 - Dye-Based Ink**

Dye-based ink is one of the most common types of ink used in inkjet printers. It consists of colorants dissolved in a liquid, usually water. This composition allows the ink to flow easily and produce vibrant colors. These inks are best for photo printing and graphics due to their bright and vivid colors. However, they are not suitable for documents that need to last for a long time.

#### **1.2 - Pigment-Based Ink**

Pigment-based ink is another common type used in inkjet printers, known for its longevity and water resistance. These inks consist of tiny particles of color suspended in the liquid. The particles sit on top of the paper rather than soaking in. Such inks are ideal for professional documents and archival-quality prints. They are perfect for items that must last a long time without fading or smudging.

#### **1.3 - Sublimation Ink**

Sublimation ink is used to transfer images onto materials like polyester and textiles. These inks are designed to turn into gas without becoming liquid first. When heated, they bond with polyester fabric or coated items. Sublimation ink is best for printing on polyester, textiles, and items like mugs and phone cases. It’s perfect for creating personalized, high-quality products.
