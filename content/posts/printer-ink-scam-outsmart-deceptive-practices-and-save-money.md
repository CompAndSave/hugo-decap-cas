## How Printer Ink is a Scam: The Dark Side of Printing

1. Low-cost Printers High-cost ink

Printer manufacturers often attract customers with low printer prices. But here's the twist: the real cost lies in those ink cartridges. This 'razor and blades' business strategy involves selling printers at a low upfront cost while generating profits from selling expensive ink cartridges.



So, how expensive are printer ink cartridges?

These ink cartridges can be shockingly expensive, sometimes costing more than luxury items like Russian caviar when you think about their weight. In fact, they can even surpass the price per gallon of a bottle of 1985 Krug vintage champagne.



In Austin McConnell's YouTube video 'Ink Cartridges Are A Scam', he shared his experiences from his previous job in technical support. He pointed out that a set of ink cartridges used to be priced at $59.95, while it only cost about $0.23 to produce one ounce of ink. This shows that printer ink cartridges have been sold to consumers at a much higher price than they're actually worth.
