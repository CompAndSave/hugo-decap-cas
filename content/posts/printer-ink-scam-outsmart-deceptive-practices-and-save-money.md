***Are ink cartridges a scam?***

In today's fast-paced world, technology is a vital part of our daily lives, and printers, particularly inkjet ones, have become essential for personal and professional tasks.

However, beneath the surface, there are practices that printer manufacturers would rather keep hidden. These include using color ink when printing black text and showing low ink warnings when cartridges are only partially empty. These persistent industry practices have led some people to question whether ink cartridges are a scam.

That's why we've created this article: to investigate whether printer ink is a scam and provide valuable insights on what you can do about it.

## How Printer Ink is a Scam: The Dark Side of Printing

### 1. Low-cost Printers High-cost ink

Printer manufacturers often attract customers with low printer prices. But here's the twist: the real cost lies in those ink cartridges. This 'razor and blades' business strategy involves selling printers at a low upfront cost while generating profits from selling expensive ink cartridges.

***So, how expensive are printer ink cartridges?***

These [ink cartridges can be shockingly expensive](https://www.compandsave.com/why-printer-ink-is-so-expensive-guide), sometimes costing more than luxury items like Russian caviar when you think about their weight. In fact, they can even surpass the price per gallon of a bottle of 1985 Krug vintage champagne.

In Austin McConnell's YouTube video '[Ink Cartridges Are A Scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHX6tHdQGiQ)', he shared his experiences from his previous job in technical support. He pointed out that a set of ink cartridges used to be priced at $59.95, while it only cost about $0.23 to produce one ounce of ink. This shows that printer ink cartridges have been sold to consumers at a much higher price than they're actually worth.

### 2. Printer Ink Consumption: What You Didn't Know

Did you know that you might be getting less than you bargained for when it comes to ink? Printers have a rather surprising ink consumption pattern. Yes, they use ink for printing documents and images – that's the obvious part. But there are some aspects that many people aren't even aware of.

**• Printer Maintenance Cycle**

We all know that keeping our printers in good shape is important, but what most people miss is how much ink these necessary tasks can actually use.

According to Rich Sulin, who leads CR's printer-testing program, most people aren't really aware of the maintenance needs of inkjets. What might surprise you is that it's pretty typical for an inkjet printer to use as much ink during maintenance as it does for actual printing, as revealed in [Consumer Reports investigation](https://www.consumerreports.org/printers/the-high-cost-of-wasted-printer-ink).

On top of it, some printers initiate printhead cleaning when you power them off and on, and in some instances, they run a cleaning cycle for every single page you print. This has been tested and confirmed in Fstoppers' YouTube video, '[Printer Ink Scam Myths Tested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1B71C6BV7k&t=17s)'.

These maintenance actions contribute to higher ink consumption, even if you don't use your printer very often.

**• Color Mixing in Black and White Prints**

One reason you may receive fewer pages than the advertised yield is the deliberate use of "cyan color mixing" by printers, even when printing in black and white.

Manufacturers claim this technique enhances the quality of black prints, but YouTuber Fstoppers conducted a test and debunked this claim in their YouTube video '[Printer Ink Scam Myths Tested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1B71C6BV7k&t=116s)'.

The result? You might get fewer printed pages than advertised and have to replace your cartridges sooner than planned.

**3. Tactics to Limit Ink Choices**

Printer manufacturers implement strategies to lock their printers into using only their ink cartridges. They employ tactics like frequent firmware updates to enforce this exclusivity.

As we all know, firmware updates are usually intended to fix problems and improve a printer's performance, especially when it comes to addressing bugs and crashes. However, when you choose to use remanufactured or third-party ink cartridges, these updates take on a different role. In this case, these updates are designed to limit your ability to use non-OEM cartridges, effectively pushing you toward the more expensive ink options the manufacturer offers.

***Interesting Fact:***

* *In 2018, HP had to pay $1.5 million in a court settlement because their printer updates caused fake error messages when people used third-party ink cartridges.*
* *In October 2019, Epson faced a class action lawsuit because their printer firmware updates blocked the use of compatible cartridges.*

**4. Intentional Product Aging**

Another concerning aspect of the printer ink scam is planned product aging. Below are some of them:

* **Printers Built to Fail**

  Imagine purchasing a printer with the expectation that it will serve you well for several years. However, it starts experiencing frequent breakdowns after some time and becomes incompatible with the latest devices. This forces you to replace the printer or invest in a new one, rendering the previously purchased ink cartridges worthless and resulting in additional expenses.
* **Forced Printer Halt**

  Chips on the cartridges can force the printer to stop operating when any color runs out, even if other colors are available. Your printer will not work until you replace the empty cartridges.
* **False Low Ink Warnings**

  Have you ever received an error message from your printer, claiming that you're low on ink, only to replace the cartridge and find that it still has plenty of ink left? This happens because some printers intentionally provide inaccurate low ink warnings, prompting premature cartridge replacements.

***Interesting Fact:***

* *HP faced three class action lawsuits in 2010, involving issues like inkjet printers incorrectly indicating low ink levels, cyan ink being used when printing with black ink, and ink cartridges disabling due to false empty cartridge alerts. This legal battle ended up costing them $5 million in settlements.*
* *Back in 2006, Epson found itself in a similar situation with a class action lawsuit. This time, it was about their inkjet printers and cartridges causing printer functions to halt due to incorrect "empty cartridge" notifications. Epson resolved the case by providing $45 e-coupons to people who had purchased their inkjet printers and cartridges between 1999 and 2006.*
* *In 2017, several major companies, including Brother, Canon, Epson, and HP, faced allegations of Planned Obsolescence in France. This practice intentionally shortens the lifespan of both printers and ink cartridges, essentially pushing consumers to spend more on their products. While these companies received a relatively modest fine of €15,000, but it was considered a small victory in a long journey.*
