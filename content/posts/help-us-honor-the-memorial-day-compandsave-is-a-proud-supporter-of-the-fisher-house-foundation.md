As a mark of respect for our fallen heroes, **we are partnering with the [Fisher House Foundation](https://www.fisherhouse.org/)** to support their Comfort Homes and other ventures. To be a part of our Memorial Day efforts, join us as we pledge to never forget the sacrifice made by the soldiers and families of the Armed Forces.

### VA recognizes The Fisher House Foundation 

The Fisher House Foundation provides a network of comfort homes for the families of US military personnel who are undergoing hospital treatment for injury, illness or disease. The families and the soldier can stay at these locations at no cost. In addition, the foundation also operates grant programs for military charities, scholarships for military kids, and the Hero Miles Program that uses donated frequent flyer miles to help bring together the families of injured soldiers.  
  
The Fisher House Foundation believes that a family's love is good medicine. With 63 houses in operation, the Foundation has:

* Provided **5.2 million days** of lodging
* Helped families **save $235,000,000** since 1990
* **Served 22,000 families** in the last year alone

The organization conducts fundraisers and other events and also accepts aid and gifts from those wishing to join and make a difference.
