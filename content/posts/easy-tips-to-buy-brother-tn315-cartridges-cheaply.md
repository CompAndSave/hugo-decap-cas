**Compatible cartridges**

People familiar with printers will certainly understand what compatibility means. There are compatible printers and there are compatible cartridges.

Compatible cartridges are those cartridges that can be used in a printer instead of the original cartridge. There are companies that specialize in making compatible cartridges. It should be noted that these are not duplicates of the original products. These are different generic products that have virtually the same properties and features of the original cartridge.

The problem with the Brother cartridges is the complex technology it uses. There are indeed some companies that manage to introduce compatible cartridges for Brother TN315 cartridges, reproducing the exact technology used in original cartridges. These cartridges too provide more than 6000 pages of print yield. The resolution and the print quality are the same as that offered by original cartridges. The price is the only difference, which is less than half that of the original price.

**Smart buying**

The internet is a good place to search for compatible versions of different types of printer cartridges. Often, you will find more than one website that offer compatible versions of [Brother TN315BK](https://www.compandsave.com/brother/tn315-toner-cartridges/tn315bk-tn315c-tn315m-tn315y-4-combo) cartridge. How will you find the right buyer?

One aspect is to check the mode procurement of the seller. If it makes bulk purchase directly from the factory, it can pass on the cost benefit to the buyers.

In addition, it would be better to deal with the companies that work through the internet. Such companies can save a lot in operational expenses and can transfer the savings to customers as price discounts.
