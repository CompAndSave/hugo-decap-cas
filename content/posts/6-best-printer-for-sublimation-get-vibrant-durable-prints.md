With so many options available, finding the best printers for t-shirts can feel overwhelming.

Whether you're a small business owner, designer, or hobbyist, selecting the right fabric printer ensures cost efficiency, durability, and professional-quality results.  Learning [how to print on fabric with an inkjet printer](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-print-on-fabric-with-inkjet-printer.html) ensures high-quality, long-lasting results for custom apparel and textiles.

**In this guide, we’ll explore:**

* The basics of fabric printing and why sublimation printing is the best choice.
* The best printer to print on fabric for different needs and budgets.
* Printer Maintenance & Troubleshooting for Fabric Printing

## **What is a Fabric Printer?**

Fabric printers apply ink using different methods, with inkjet printing being the most common. Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of ink onto fabric, creating vibrant prints. Sublimation printers use heat to transfer dye onto polyester and synthetic fabrics, making them the best printer for sublimation.

### **Sublimation Printing vs. Direct-to-Garment (DTG) vs. Screen Printing**

* **Sublimation printing:** Uses heat to transfer dye onto fabric, providing vibrant, long-lasting prints. It’s best for polyester and is the best fabric for sublimation printing.
* **Direct-to-Garment (DTG):** Involves printing designs directly onto fabric with inkjet technology. It’s great for cotton fabrics and is one of the best printers for t-shirts.
* **Screen printing:** Involves pushing ink through a mesh screen to apply designs. It’s cost-effective for large runs but lacks the detail and flexibility of inkjet printing on fabric.

### **Common Uses of Fabric Printers**

Fabric printers are used for:

* **Custom apparel:** Printing unique designs on t-shirts, hoodies, and other clothing.
* **Textile design:** Creating patterns for home décor and fashion.
* **Promotional products:** Printing on items like tote bags and banners.
