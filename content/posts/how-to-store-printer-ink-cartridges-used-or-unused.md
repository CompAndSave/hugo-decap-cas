## Printer Ink Cartridges: Causes Of Drying Out

Printer ink cartridges are small plastic containers that hold ink for inkjet printers. They are designed to supply ink to the printer to create text and images on paper. When you print something, the cartridge releases tiny drops of ink onto the paper to form the letters and pictures you see.

They usually have a small chip or circuit to communicate with the printer, telling it how much ink is left. Inside, there’s also a sponge that helps hold the ink until it’s used. Some cartridges have separate compartments for different ink colors (like cyan, magenta, yellow, and black), while others have all the colors in one container. Unfortunately, these cartridges can dry out.

### So, what are some reasons that can cause cartridges to dry out?

* Cartridges that sit unused for a long time
* Keeping cartridges near heat sources or in direct sunlight 
* Leaving cartridges unsealed or exposed to air 
* Not storing them in the correct position

## How To Store Printer Ink Cartridges Unopened?

Storing unopened printer ink cartridges the right way is essential to make sure they last longer and work well when you need them. If they're not stored correctly, the ink can dry out, or the cartridge might not work. To avoid wasting money and ensure your cartridges are ready to use, here are some simple tips on how to store printer ink cartridges correctly.

### 1. Store In A Cool, Dry Place

Keep your ink cartridges in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Sunlight can dry out the ink, so it's best to put them in a drawer or cupboard. Also, try to keep the room temperature between 50°F and 85°F (10°C to 30°C) because extreme temperature changes can damage the ink. 

### 2. Keep Them Sealed

Another tip on what to do with unused printer ink cartridges is to keep them in their original packaging until you need them. This helps prevent air from getting in and drying out the ink.

### 3. Keep Them Upright 

To protect your ink cartridges and keep the ink safe, store them standing up. This simple step helps prevent the ink from settling and lowers the chances of leaks.

### 4. Rotation System

How to store printer ink cartridges when not in use? Use an "oldest first" rule for your ink cartridges. This means you should use the ones that have been around the longest before the newer ones. This way, you ensure they don’t get too old and stop working well. 

### 5. Consider Manufacturer Recommendations

Always look for any storage tips from the printer manufacturer. Following their advice can help keep your ink cartridges in good condition.

## How To Preserve Ink Cartridges That Are Opened?

Now that we know how to store unopened cartridges, let's talk about those already opened. How can we preserve them? Here, we’ve listed some tips on how to preserve ink cartridges that are opened so you can use them for a longer time without worrying about them drying out:

### 1. Properly Seal the Cartridge

To preserve opened ink cartridges, it's essential to seal them properly after use. Start by putting back any clips or seals that came with the cartridges if they were removed. Avoid using regular sticky tape, as it could leave residue. Doing this will ensure they stay fresh and ready to print anytime.

### 2. Store Upright

Just like with unopened cartridges, keep your opened cartridges standing upright. This simple step helps prevent the ink from settling and drying out inside the cartridge, which can lead to blockages and affect the quality of your prints.

### 3. Use Airtight Containers

Another way on how to store printer cartridges that are opened is to put them in airtight containers. This prevents air from getting in and drying out the ink. Ensure the cartridges are placed with the nozzles facing up to avoid leaks.

### 4. Keep in a Cool, Dark Place

Store your used cartridges in a cool, dark area away from direct sunlight and heat sources. This helps protect the ink quality and prevents it from boiling or leaking due to excessive heat.

## How To Store Toner Cartridges: Best Practices For Longevity

Not only must ink cartridges be stored correctly, but toner cartridges also require proper storage to ensure they last as long as possible. Following some simple tips can help maintain the quality of the toner and prevent issues like clumping or damage. So, here are some things on what to do with unused toner cartridges:

### 1. Keep Them In A Cool, Dry Place

Store toner cartridges in a cool, dry environment away from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures. Ideal storage temperatures range from 50°F to 77°F (10°C to 25°C) to prevent the toner from clumping or deteriorating.

### 2. Use Original Packaging

Whenever possible, keep toner cartridges in their original packaging. This protects them from dust, moisture, and light exposure, which can degrade the toner quality.

### 3. Avoid Chemical Exposure

Do not store toner cartridges near cleaning supplies or chemicals, as fumes can degrade the toner composition and affect performance.

### 4. Rotate Stock Regularly

Implement a "first-in, first-out" system by using older toner cartridges first. This helps prevent them from expiring or becoming obsolete while ensuring optimal performance.

## Stored Ink Cartridges Not Working: Troubleshooting Steps

Stored ink cartridges can sometimes stop working, which can be a hassle. If you find that your cartridges are not functioning correctly, below are several troubleshooting steps you can take to identify and fix the problem. 

### 1. Tapping Method

Hold the cartridge carefully by its sides, avoiding contact with the print head or electrical parts, and give it a gentle tap with your fingers to help loosen any dried ink that may be clogging the nozzles. Just be cautious not to tap too hard, as you don’t want to damage the cartridge.

### 2. Clean The Nozzles

Dampen a paper towel with warm water and gently wipe the cartridge's nozzles. This can help remove dried ink blocking the flow and improve print quality. Remember, tap water can contain impurities that might worsen things, so stick to distilled water for this job. Also, you can check this guide, “[How to Clean Printhead?](https://www.compandsave.com/blog/posts/how-to-clean-printhead-automatic-and-manual-guide-2024.html)” for more tips.

### 3. Check For Air Bubbles

Sometimes, air bubbles can form in the cartridge, preventing ink from flowing properly. To fix this, remove the cartridge and gently tap it on a hard surface or lightly squeeze it while holding it upright. This can help dislodge any air bubbles and restore proper ink flow.

### 4. Reset The Cartridge 

Some printers allow you to reset the ink cartridge. Check your printer's manual for instructions on how to do this, or if you have Epson printers, you can follow this guide on how to [reset Epson ink cartridge without resetter](https://www.compandsave.com/how-to-reset-epson-ink-cartridge-guide).

## Frequently Asked Questions 

### 1. How long can ink cartridges be stored?

Ink cartridges can typically be stored for about two years if sealed in their original packaging. After this time, they may still work, but the ink could start to dry out and affect print quality. Opened cartridges usually last around six months before they dry up, so it's best to use them within that time frame.

### 2. What should I do if my stored ink cartridge has dried?

If your stored ink cartridge has dried out, there are a few steps you can take to try to fix it. First, gently tap the cartridge on a warm, damp paper towel to help loosen any dried ink. You can also soak the cartridge in warm water for about 15 seconds, ensuring the nozzles are covered, and then wipe it with a paper towel to see if the ink starts flowing again. You can also check this guide, “[Does Printer Ink Dry Out?](https://www.compandsave.com/does-printer-ink-dry-out)” for more detailed troubleshooting steps. 

### 3. Is it okay to shake an ink cartridge before installing it in the printer?

You can shake an ink cartridge before installing it, which helps mix the ink and ensures an even flow. Just hold the cartridge horizontally and give it a gentle shake about 15 times to redistribute the ink inside. However, avoid shaking it too hard, as that could cause leaks or damage to the cartridge.
