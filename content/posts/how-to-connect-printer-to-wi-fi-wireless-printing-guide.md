## Connect To Wireless Printer: What Are Some Advantages?

Before we discuss how to connect wireless printer to wifi, let’s find out some of its advantages. Connecting to a wireless printer has many benefits that make printing easier and faster. Without the need for cables, you can print from different devices, whether you’re at home, in the office, or even on the go. Additionally, here are some main advantages of using a wireless printer:

### 1. Less Clutter

Printing wirelessly helps keep your workspace neat and organized since there are no cables running between your computer and the printer. This is especially helpful in small home offices or shared workspaces where fewer cables make the area look tidier and more organized.

### 2. Can Be Used By Multiple People

With a wireless printer, multiple users can connect and print from their devices. For example, in a family home, parents and kids can all send documents to the same printer from their smartphones, tablets, or laptops. In an office setting, employees can share one printer without connecting directly, making printing quick and easy for everyone.

### 3. Print Anywhere

You can print documents from any room in your home or office if you’re within the Wi-Fi range when printing wirelessly. For example, if you’re working on your laptop in the living room, you can easily send a document to print in your home office without needing to get up and connect your device to the printer. This flexibility makes printing tasks much more manageable and efficient.

## How To Connect Printer To Wi-Fi: Two Methods To Try

Now that we know some advantages of connecting your printer wirelessly, you might be wondering, "How do I connect my printer to Wifi?" There are two methods you can use to set up a wireless connection: connect the printer directly or connect via the WPS push button. Let's go over both options so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. And yes! These methods generally work for most major printer brands.

### Method #1: Directly Connect Printer to Wi-Fi

The first method is connecting a wireless printer directly to your Wi-Fi router. These steps are for printers with a touchscreen where you can easily see and adjust the settings. Make sure your printer is within range of your Wi-Fi router. Follow the steps below to set up your wireless printer using this direct Wi-Fi method. 

**Step 1:** Turn on your Wi-Fi router.

**Step 2:** On your printer’s screen, click the **Settings** button.

**Step 3:** Go to **Wi-Fi or Wireless Connection Settings** and click **Add.** This will show you all the available Wi-Fi connections in the area.

**Step 4:** Connect the printer to your home or office’s Wi-Fi using the network SSID and password.

**Step 5:** Once you choose the correct SSID and enter the appropriate password, your printer will quickly connect to the Wi-Fi.

This is the most straightforward way to connect your printer to Wi-Fi. But if you have an older printer without a screen, don’t worry. There’s another method you can use. You can quickly connect your printer to Wi-Fi using the WPS Push Button.

### Method #2: Connect Printer To Wi-Fi With WPS Push Button[](https://www.compandsave.com/what-ink-does-my-printer-use)

The second method on how to connect printer to wifi is by using the WPS push button on both the printer and the Wi-Fi device. If your printer doesn’t have a touchscreen control panel but has a wireless connectivity option, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** Turn on the printer and look for the WPS button on the side of the printer. There will be a little push button with the WPS icon.

**Step 2:** Push the WPS button on your printer, then press the WPS button on your router. Make sure to do this within two minutes. An automatic connection will be established between the two devices. The printer’s light will blink to show it’s connected to the Wi-Fi.

**Step 3:** If the printer won’t connect, try to push the WPS button on the Wi-Fi device first.

When the printer’s light blinks, the connection to Wi-Fi is successful.

## How Do I Connect My Printer To Wifi And Then To Laptop?

Once you’ve successfully connected your printer to your Wi-Fi network, the next step is to add it to your computer so you can start using it. The guide below will show you how to add your wireless printer if you’re using either a Windows or Mac operating system.
