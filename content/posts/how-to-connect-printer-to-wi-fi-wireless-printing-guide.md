We live in an age of wireless technology, so there are a lot of wireless printers coming out on the market. Printing using a Wi-Fi connection has made our lives easier. How does a wireless printer work? Wi-Fi uses radio signals to transmit data to devices within the same network. When your printer and gadgets share the same network, they can now transmit data to each other.

When you're in an office, you can print directly from your laptop without having to connect bundles of wires to the office printer. At home, wireless printing allows you to print photos or documents easily from your gadgets.

If you have a wireless printer but don’t know how to connect your printer to Wi-Fi, it’s time to learn the know-how. Soon, you’ll enjoy the convenience of printing wirelessly. This brief wireless printing guide will help you connect your printer to your home or office’s Wi-Fi 



## Wireless Printing Guide

There are two different methods that you can follow in order to learn how to connect printer to Wi-Fi. Let's discuss both of them so you can choose the one according to your needs. Both methods are generally applicable to any major printer brand.

The first method is how to connect a wireless printer directly to your Wi-Fi router. The steps below are for printers with a touchscreen control panel where you can see the settings and navigate.
