## Connect To Wireless Printer: What Are Some Advantages?

Before we discuss how to connect wireless printer to wifi, let’s find out some of its advantages. Connecting to a wireless printer has many benefits that make printing easier and faster. Without the need for cables, you can print from different devices, whether you’re at home, in the office, or even on the go. Additionally, here are some main advantages of using a wireless printer:

### 1. Less Clutter

Printing wirelessly helps keep your workspace neat and organized since there are no cables running between your computer and the printer. This is especially helpful in small home offices or shared workspaces where fewer cables make the area look tidier and more organized.

### 2. Can Be Used By Multiple People

With a wireless printer, multiple users can connect and print from their devices. For example, in a family home, parents and kids can all send documents to the same printer from their smartphones, tablets, or laptops. In an office setting, employees can share one printer without connecting directly, making printing quick and easy for everyone.

### 3. Print Anywhere

You can print documents from any room in your home or office if you’re within the Wi-Fi range when printing wirelessly. For example, if you’re working on your laptop in the living room, you can easily send a document to print in your home office without needing to get up and connect your device to the printer. This flexibility makes printing tasks much more manageable and efficient.

## How To Connect Printer To Wi-Fi: Two Methods To Try

Now that we know some advantages of connecting your printer wirelessly, you might be wondering, "How do I connect my printer to Wifi?" There are two methods you can use to set up a wireless connection: connect the printer directly or connect via the WPS push button. Let's go over both options so you can choose the one that best suits your needs. And yes! These methods generally work for most major printer brands.

### Method #1: Directly Connect Printer to Wi-Fi

**Step 4:** Connect the printer to your home or office’s Wi-Fi using the network SSID and password.

**Step 5:** Once you choose the correct SSID and enter the appropriate password, your printer will quickly connect to the Wi-Fi.
